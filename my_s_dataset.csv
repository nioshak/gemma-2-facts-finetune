high blood pressure 
 People who have consistent high blood pressure (hypertension) in mid-life (ages 45 to 65) are more likely to develop dementia compared to those with normal blood pressure.
 

 High blood pressure can increase the risk of developing dementia, particularly vascular dementia, because of its effect on the heart, the arteries, and blood circulation.
 

 Smoking 
 The evidence is strong and consistent that smokers are at a higher risk of developing dementia vs. non-smokers or ex-smokers.
 

 It’s never too late to quit! Smokers who quit can reduce their risk of developing dementia.
 

 diabetes 
 People with type 2 diabetes in mid-life (ages 45 to 65) are at an increased risk of developing dementia, particularly Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia.
 

 Obesity
 Obesity in mid-life (ages 45 to 65) increases the risk of developing dementia. Obesity also increases the risk of developing other risk factors such as type 2 diabetes.
 

 lack of physical activity 
 Physical inactivity in later life (ages 65 and up) increases the risk of developing dementia.
 

 poor diet
 An unhealthy diet, high in saturated fat, sugar, and salt, can increase the risk of developing many illnesses, including dementia and cardiovascular disease.
 

 high alcohol consumption 
 Drinking excessively (more than 12 drinks per week), can increase your risk of developing dementia
 

 low cognitive engagement 
 Cognitive engagement is thought to support the development of a
 “cognitive reserve”. This is the idea that people who actively use their brains throughout their lives may be more protected against brain cell damage caused by dementia.
 

 depression 
 People who experience depression in mid- or later life have a higher risk of developing dementia. However, the relationship between depression and dementia is still unclear.
 

 Many researchers believe that depression is a risk factor for dementia, whereas others believe it may be an early symptom of the disease, or both.
 

 traumatic brain injury 
 People who experience severe or repeated head injuries are at increased risk of developing dementia. Brain injuries may trigger a process that might eventually lead to dementia.
 

 This particularly affects athletes in boxing, soccer, hockey, and football, which often have repeated head injuries.
 

 Falls are the leading cause of traumatic brain injury. Falling is especially dangerous for older adults.
 

 hearing loss
 Mild levels of hearing loss increase the risk of cognitive decline and dementia. Though it is still unclear how exactly it affects cognitive decline, hearing loss can lead to social isolation, loss of independence, and problems with everyday activities.
 

 social isolation
 Social isolation can increase the risk of hypertension, coronary heart disease, depression, and dementia.
 

 Staying socially active may reduce the risk of dementia. Social interaction may also help slow down the progression of the disease.
 

 air pollution
 The relationship between air pollution and dementia is still unclear. However, it’s estimated that those living close to busy roads have a higher risk of dementia because they may be exposed to higher levels of air pollution from vehicle emissions.
 

 It’s never too soon, or too late, to make changes that will maintain or improve your brain health. Learn more about managing some of these risk factors.

USER REQUEST:
I'm middle-aged, never smoked, had my ears blown out in the war, get a case of the sads pretty regular, and eat mostly garbage. What are my risk factors for dementia? What does cognitive engagement have to do with it?","Based on the provided document and your description:

Your risk factors for dementia include:
*   **Hearing loss**: ""Mild levels of hearing loss increase the risk of cognitive decline and dementia"" (hearing loss).
*   **Depression**: ""People who experience depression in mid- or later life have a higher risk of developing dementia"" (depression).
*   **Poor diet**: ""An unhealthy diet, high in saturated fat, sugar, and salt, can increase the risk of developing many illnesses, including dementia and cardiovascular disease"" (poor diet).

Regarding smoking, the document states that ""smokers are at a higher risk of developing dementia vs. non-smokers or ex-smokers,"" indicating that never smoking is not a risk factor (Smoking).

Cognitive engagement is thought to support the development of a “cognitive reserve” (low cognitive engagement). This means that ""people who actively use their brains throughout their lives may be more protected against brain cell damage caused by dementia"" (low cognitive engagement).","It sounds like you're thinking proactively about your brain health, which is a great first step! Based on what you've shared, here are some of the potential risk factors for dementia that apply to you, according to the information provided:

1.  **Hearing Loss:** You mentioned ""had my ears blown out in the war."" Even mild levels of hearing loss can increase the risk of cognitive decline and dementia. While the exact link isn't fully understood, it can lead to social isolation and problems with everyday activities, which are also connected to brain health.
2.  **Depression:** You said you ""get a case of the sads pretty regular,"" which suggests you experience depression. People who experience depression in mid- or later life have a higher risk of developing dementia. Researchers are still figuring out if depression is a direct risk factor, an early symptom of dementia, or both.
3.  **Poor Diet:** Eating ""mostly garbage"" aligns with an unhealthy diet. A diet high in saturated fat, sugar, and salt can increase the risk of many illnesses, including dementia and cardiovascular disease.
4.  **Traumatic Brain Injury (Potential):** While ""ears blown out"" directly points to hearing loss, it's also worth considering if this incident involved any head trauma. Severe or repeated head injuries are known to increase the risk of developing dementia.

It's excellent that you've never smoked, as the evidence strongly shows that smokers are at a higher risk of developing dementia.

### What does cognitive engagement have to do with it?

You also asked about cognitive engagement, which is a really important aspect of brain health!

*   **Cognitive engagement** refers to actively using your brain through activities that stimulate it. This could include learning new things, solving puzzles, reading, engaging in intellectually challenging hobbies, or even just having stimulating conversations.
*   The document explains that cognitive engagement is thought to support the development of a ""**cognitive reserve**."" This is like building up a mental buffer. The idea is that people who actively use their brains throughout their lives may be more protected against brain cell damage caused by dementia. Even if some brain changes associated with dementia begin to occur, a strong cognitive reserve might help your brain compensate and function better for longer, potentially delaying the onset or slowing the progression of symptoms.

The good news is that it's ""never too soon, or too late, to make changes that will maintain or improve your brain health."" Focusing on improving your diet, seeking support for depression, addressing your hearing loss, and finding ways to boost your cognitive engagement can all be very beneficial steps."

Knife sharpening angles
Manufacturer´s recommendations
The recommended angle of your knife is often written on the knife’s packaging. If you
don’t find it there you can often find it on the manufacturer’s website. Below you’ll find
the angle recommendations from some “well-known” knife manufacturers.
Please note that despite the fact that the vast majority of knives are dual-bevel, knife
manufacturers list their edge angles based on the number of degrees of a single bevel.
For example, dual bevel listed as 15 degrees is actually two 15-degree angles, or 30
degrees total. Therefore, all angles in this document is listed as single bevel angles.
Cangshan
Cangshan knives are sharpened to an Asian-style 16-degree edge. Learn more at their website.
Chroma
A Chroma knife should be sharpened to 10-20 degrees. Learn more at their website.
F. DICK (Friedr. DICK)
Dick recommends 15-20 degrees for their DICK Hoof Knives. Learn more at their website.
Fischer-Bargoin
Fischer-Bargoin recommends an angle of 15-20 degrees. Learn more at their website.
Global
Global recommends an angle of 10-15 degrees. Learn more at their website.
Korin
Korin knives recommends a 10-20 degrees angle on their Western style knives. For their traditional
Japanese knife see please go to the website. Learn more at their website.
MAC
MAC knives have factory edges of 15 degrees. Their recommendation is 10-15 degrees. Learn more
at their website.
Messermeister
Messermeister Elité and Park Plaza knives have a 15-degree angle. Learn more at their website.
Starting in 2018, the Four Seasons knife collection now features a 15-degree angle. Learn more at
their website.
Shun and Kai
Shun recommends a 16-degree angle of Shun and Kai double-beveled knives. Learn more at their
website.
Victorinox
Victorinox indicates the total cutting angle. Sharpening a Victorinox should be between 30 to 40
degrees, which is 15-20 degrees on each side. Learn more at their website.
Wüsthof
The sharpening angle for standard blades is 14 degrees, and for Asian-style blades (Santokus, Nakiris, Chai Daos) it’s 10 degrees. Learn more at their website.
Zwilling J. A. Henckels and Miyabi
The angle between the blade and the steel should be approximately 15 degrees for ZWILLING
knives. Santoku knives and all MIYABI and Kramer made by ZWILLING knives need to be 9-12 degrees. Learn more at their website.
Set the existing knife angle using Tormek Marker Method
If you want to repeat an existing angle but don’t know the angle of your knife, the easiest
way is to use the Tormek Marker Method with a black permanent marker. By following three
simple steps you can quickly get the correct angle.
1. Color the bevel, mount the knife in the jig and place it onto the Universal Support.
2. Turn the grinding wheel by hand and check where the coloring is removed,
3. Raise or lower the Universal Support until the coloring is removed from the tip to the
heel. Now, the angle is just right and it’s time to start sharpening!

USER REQUEST:
Can you list all the knife brands that sell knives suitable for sharpening at a 14-degree angle? List them according to the minimum angle at which their knives can be sharpened, starting with the smallest.","The knife brands that sell knives suitable for sharpening at a 14-degree angle, listed according to the minimum angle at which their knives can be sharpened (starting with the smallest), are:

*   Chroma: ""10-20 degrees"" (Chroma)
*   Global: ""10-15 degrees"" (Global)
*   Korin: ""10-20 degrees angle on their Western style knives"" (Korin)
*   MAC: ""recommendation is 10-15 degrees"" (MAC)
*   Wüsthof: ""sharpening angle for standard blades is 14 degrees, and for Asian-style blades... it’s 10 degrees"" (Wüsthof)","It looks like you're looking to keep your knives in top shape! Sharpening at the correct angle is crucial for performance and longevity.

Based on the document, here are the knife brands that offer models suitable for sharpening at a 14-degree angle. All of these brands also have certain knife styles that can be sharpened down to a minimum of 10 degrees:

*   **Chroma:** Recommends sharpening between 10-20 degrees.
*   **Global:** Recommends an angle of 10-15 degrees.
*   **Korin:** Recommends a 10-20 degree angle for their Western-style knives.
*   **MAC:** Recommends an angle of 10-15 degrees (factory edges are 15 degrees).
*   **Wüsthof:** Explicitly states 14 degrees for their standard blades, and 10 degrees for their Asian-style blades.

It's great that you're paying attention to the specific angle! As the document mentions, most manufacturers list their edge angles based on a single bevel, even if the knife has a dual-bevel (meaning two bevels, one on each side, forming the total cutting angle). So, when a brand recommends ""14 degrees,"" they typically mean 14 degrees per side, resulting in a total cutting angle of 28 degrees.

If you ever find yourself with a knife and don't know its existing angle, the **Tormek Marker Method** described in your document is a fantastic tip! Just color the bevel, mount the knife, and adjust your sharpening setup until the coloring is removed evenly from tip to heel. This ensures you maintain the knife's original geometry. Happy sharpening!"

This document offers a fantastic range of tips, covering everything from daily habits to larger purchases. Let's break down some of the best advice for keeping more cash in your pocket:

### Recreation and Entertainment

Who says you can't have fun on a budget?

*   **Free or Cheaper Fitness:** Skip expensive gym memberships. Opt for home weights, campus facilities (like the ARC mentioned here), or simply enjoy outdoor activities.
*   **Avoid Smoking:** This is a big one! Cigarettes are costly, and fines for smoking near school facilities add up.
*   **Smart Event Attendance:** For sporting events, try waiting until after half-time for free entry. For campus activities, look for free student concerts, club events, or church-sponsored gatherings (which often include food!).
*   **Illini Union's Free Fun:** If you're at the University of Illinois, take advantage of ""Illinites"" every Friday night for free activities.
*   **Cultural Experiences on a Budget:** Attend shows at places like Krannert. Student tickets are often $10 or less, and sometimes even free!
*   **Savvy Dining Out:** Always look for coupons and special deals. And remember, ordering water instead of other drinks can save a surprising amount, as beverages are usually highly marked up.
*   **Coupon Books:** Grab local business coupon books, especially at the beginning of a semester.
*   **Party Planning:** If you're hosting, have guests chip in a little money or bring items to help offset your costs.
*   **Library Love:** Instead of buying books you might only read once, check them out for free from the library.
*   **Cheap Movie Nights:** Rent movies with friends to split the cost, or visit second-run theaters where tickets are only $1 or $2. Always bring your student ID for potential discounts!

### Food and Basic Needs

Everyday essentials are a great place to start saving!

*   **Research Big Purchases:** Before a major buy, consult resources like Consumer Reports to ensure quality.
*   **Generic Brands:** Often, the cheaper, generic versions of products (especially medications) work just as well as their expensive counterparts.
*   **DIY Beauty:** Ladies, consider cosmetology schools for cheaper hair services instead of pricey salons.
*   **Smart Bulk Buying:** While buying in bulk can save money, always check the ""per unit price"" to ensure you're getting the best deal. Bigger isn't always cheaper!
*   **Secondhand Treasures:** Scout out garage/yard sales for housewares, furniture, and dorm decor. The YMCA's ""dump and run"" at the beginning of semesters is also a great resource.
*   **Thoughtful Gifting:** Make gifts! It's cheaper, and the personal touch shows you truly care.
*   **Early Gift Shopping:** Take advantage of sales throughout the year to buy holiday and birthday gifts ahead of time.
*   **Employee Discounts:** Get a job at a place where you frequently spend money to enjoy employee discounts.
*   **Coupons & Rebates:** Don't forget mail-in rebates or grocery coupons for food, health, and beauty items.
*   **Ditch Bottled Water:** Invest in a water filtration pitcher instead of constantly buying bottled water.
*   **Needs vs. Wants:** Don't buy something just because it's on sale. Always ask yourself if you truly need it.
*   **Store Discount Cards:** If your favorite store has one, apply for their discount card.
*   **Home-Cooked Meals:** Eating at home is almost always cheaper and often healthier than dining out or getting fast food.
*   **Pack Your Lunch:** Bringing a packed lunch to school or work is a simple yet effective way to avoid daily restaurant tabs.

### Clothing

Looking good doesn't have to break the bank.

*   **End-of-Season Sales:** Buy clothes when they're on sale at the end of the season.
*   **Sell Unused Items:** Take clothes you no longer wear to consignment shops or sell them online to recoup some costs and free up closet space.
*   **Share Special Occasion Attire:** For events like proms or formals, share dresses and tuxes with friends.
*   **Ask for Discounts:** If you're buying multiple items (like several shirts), always ask if a discount is available.
*   **Invest in Quality:** Sometimes, buying one durable, well-made item is more cost-effective in the long run than buying many cheap items that wear out quickly.

### Budgeting/Spending Plan

These tips are the foundation of good financial health.

*   **Set Goals:** Define what you want to save for and how much you're willing to spend.
*   **Track Your Spending:** Knowing where your money goes is crucial. Use apps or a simple notebook to keep tabs.
*   **Credit Card Caution:** Be extremely careful with credit cards. People with credit cards often spend significantly more (34% on average!), so use them only if you can pay them off immediately.
*   **Set Spending Limits:** Before you go out, decide on a spending limit and stick to it.
*   **The ""Two-Hour Rule"":** For big purchases, wait at least two hours (or even a day!) to ensure it's something you genuinely need and not an impulse buy.

### Transportation

Gas, insurance, and maintenance can add up.

*   **Obey Traffic Laws:** Speeding tickets aren't just a fine; they can raise your insurance premiums.
*   **Tire Maintenance:** Properly inflated tires improve gas mileage.
*   **Good Grades = Lower Insurance:** Many insurance companies offer discounts to students with a GPA of 3.0 or higher.
*   **Carpool:** Share rides with friends to save on gas.
*   **Fuel-Efficient Cars:** When buying a car, prioritize dependability and good gas mileage.
*   **Older Cars:** Driving an older car often means lower insurance payments and taxes.
*   **Alternative Transport:** Walk, bike, or use public transport (like riding to school) to save on gas and get some exercise.
*   **Shop for Gas Prices:** Use apps to find the cheapest gas prices in your area before filling up.

### Savings

Little changes add up to big results!

*   **Use Your Bank's ATMs:** Avoid fees by only using ATMs affiliated with your own bank.
*   **Automate Savings:** Set up automatic transfers to move a portion of every paycheck into your savings account.
*   **Piggy Bank Power:** Don't underestimate the value of spare change! Get a piggy bank or change jar and watch it grow.
*   **Volunteer:** If you're busy volunteering, you're less likely to spend money. Plus, it boosts your resume and feels good to give back!
*   **Repurpose:** Use plastic grocery bags as small trash can liners instead of buying new ones.

### Conserving Resources

Saving the planet can also save you money!

*   **Water Conservation:** Turn off the water while brushing your teeth.
*   **Unplug Electronics:** Even when turned off, electronics can draw ""phantom power."" Unplug them when not in use to save energy.
*   **Use Sparingly:** Be mindful of how much shampoo, toothpaste, and paper towels you use. Enough to do the job, without waste!
*   **Online Bills:** Pay bills online to save on stamps and paper.
*   **Seal Leaks:** If you rent, ask your landlord to seal gaps around doors and windows to prevent heat leaks in winter, which can reduce heating costs.

By incorporating even a few of these tips into your daily life, you'll be well on your way to better money management and a healthier financial future!"

Description of the disease: Leptospirosis is a transmissible disease of animals and humans caused
by infection with any of the pathogenic members of the genus Leptospira. Acute leptospirosis should
be suspected in the following cases: sudden onset of agalactia (in adult milking cattle and sheep);
icterus and haemoglobinuria, especially in young animals; meningitis; and acute renal failure or
jaundice in dogs. Chronic leptospirosis should be considered in the following cases: abortion,
stillbirth, birth of weak offspring (may be premature); infertility; chronic renal failure or chronic active
hepatitis in dogs; and cases of periodic ophthalmia in horses.

USER REQUEST:
What are all  the contexts when it is right for testing for leptospirosis in dogs specifically?",Acute leptospirosis should be suspected in dogs experiencing acute renal failure or jaundice (Description of the disease). Chronic leptospirosis should be considered in dogs experiencing chronic renal failure or chronic active hepatitis (Description of the disease).,"Based on the document provided, there are a few specific contexts when testing for leptospirosis in dogs would be appropriate, depending on whether the condition is acute (sudden onset) or chronic (long-lasting):

**For Acute Leptospirosis in Dogs, you should consider testing if your dog exhibits:**
*   **Acute renal failure:** This means a sudden and severe decline in kidney function.
*   **Jaundice:** This is a yellowing of the skin, mucous membranes, and whites of the eyes, often indicating liver or red blood cell issues.

**For Chronic Leptospirosis in Dogs, you should consider testing if your dog exhibits:**
*   **Chronic renal failure:** This refers to a gradual and ongoing decline in kidney function over time.
*   **Chronic active hepatitis:** This indicates a long-term inflammation of the liver.

In essence, if your dog shows signs of sudden kidney or liver issues (jaundice, acute renal failure) or more prolonged, ongoing problems with their kidneys or liver (chronic renal failure, chronic active hepatitis), it would be a good idea to discuss leptospirosis testing with your veterinarian. Leptospirosis can be a serious disease, and early diagnosis and treatment are crucial for the best outcome."

This Regulation provides for full harmonisation as regards the third countries whose nationals are subject to a requirement to be in possession of a visa for the crossing of Member States' external borders (also referred to herein as ‘the visa requirement’) and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement. The determination of the third countries whose nationals are subject to, or exempt from, the visa requirement should be made on the basis of a considered, case-by-case assessment of a variety of criteria. That assessment should be made periodically and could lead to legislative proposals to amend Annex I to this Regulation, which lists the third countries whose nationals are required to be in possession of a visa when crossing the external borders of the Member States, and Annex II to this Regulation, which lists the third countries whose nationals are exempt from the requirement to be in possession of a visa when crossing the external borders of the Member States for stays of no more than 90 days in any 180-day period, notwithstanding the possibility of having country-specific amendments to those Annexes in particular circumstances, for instance as a result of a visa liberalisation process or as the ultimate consequence of a temporary suspension of the exemption from the visa requirement (also referred to herein as ‘the visa exemption’). The composition of the lists of third countries in Annexes I and II should be, and should remain, consistent with the criteria set out in this Regulation. References to third countries in respect of which the situation has changed as regards those criteria should be transferred from one Annex to the other. Developments in international law entailing changes in the status or designation of certain States or entities should be reflected in Annexes I and II. As the Agreement on the European Economic Area exempts nationals of Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway from the visa requirement, those countries should not be included in the list in Annex II. Since the Agreement between the European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and the Swiss Confederation, of the other part, on the free movement of persons provides for free movement without visas for nationals of Switzerland and of the Member States, Switzerland should not be included in the list in Annex II. As regards recognised refugees and stateless persons, without prejudice to obligations under international agreements signed by the Member States and in particular the European Agreement on the Abolition of Visas for Refugees of the Council of Europe, signed at Strasbourg on 20 April 1959, the decision as to the visa requirement or exemption should be based on the third country in which those persons reside and which issued their travel documents. However, given the differences in the national law applicable to recognised refugees and to stateless persons, Member States should be able to decide whether those categories of persons should be exempted, where the third country in which those persons reside and which issued their travel documents is a third country whose nationals are exempt from the visa requirement.

can you summarise all the important information relevant to Annex 1 nationals and refugees?","Annex I lists the third countries whose nationals are required to be in possession of a visa when crossing the external borders of the Member States (Regulation). The determination of countries for Annex I is based on a considered, case-by-case assessment of various criteria, which is made periodically and may lead to legislative proposals to amend Annex I (Regulation).

Regarding recognised refugees, the decision on visa requirements or exemptions should be based on the third country where they reside and which issued their travel documents, without prejudice to obligations under international agreements like the European Agreement on the Abolition of Visas for Refugees (Regulation). Member States can decide whether to exempt recognised refugees (and stateless persons) if the third country of their residence and travel document issuance is a country whose nationals are exempt from the visa requirement, due to differences in national law (Regulation).","Certainly! Let's break down the important information regarding nationals listed in Annex I and recognized refugees, based on the document you provided.

### For Nationals Listed in Annex I

*   **Who they are:** Annex I lists the third countries whose citizens **are required** to have a visa when they cross the external borders of the Member States. This is often simply called ""the visa requirement.""
*   **How the list is created and maintained:**
    *   The decision to include a country in Annex I (or Annex II) is made after a careful, case-by-case assessment using various criteria.
    *   This assessment is done regularly, and based on its findings, legislative proposals can be made to update Annex I.
    *   It's also possible to make specific, country-by-country changes to Annex I under particular circumstances. For example, if a country undergoes a ""visa liberalisation process,"" they might be moved from Annex I to Annex II. Conversely, a temporary suspension of a visa exemption could lead to a country being moved to Annex I.
    *   The criteria for being on this list must be consistently applied and maintained. If a country's situation changes significantly according to these criteria, it might be moved from Annex I to Annex II, or vice versa.
    *   Any major changes in international law that affect the status or designation of a state or entity will also be reflected in Annex I.

In essence, if your country is listed in Annex I, you will need a visa to enter the Member States' external borders.

### For Recognized Refugees and Stateless Persons

*   **General rule for visa requirement:** For recognized refugees and stateless persons, the decision on whether they need a visa or are exempt is primarily based on:
    *   The **third country where they reside**.
    *   The **third country that issued their travel documents**.
*   **International obligations:** This rule operates without overriding existing international agreements, especially the European Agreement on the Abolition of Visas for Refugees, signed in Strasbourg in 1959. This means that if an international agreement grants them visa-free travel, that obligation stands.
*   **Member State discretion:** Here's a key point: Due to differences in national laws concerning recognized refugees and stateless persons, **individual Member States have the ability to decide** whether these individuals should be exempt from the visa requirement. This discretion applies *if* the third country where they reside and which issued their travel documents is one whose nationals are generally exempt from the visa requirement.

So, for refugees, it's a bit more nuanced. While the country of residence and travel document issuance is the starting point, international agreements and the specific decisions of individual Member States play a significant role in determining their visa status.

I hope this comprehensive summary helps clarify these points!"

2.1 Overarching principles of tax policy
In a context where many governments have to cope with less revenue, 
increasing expenditures and resulting fiscal constraints, raising revenue 
remains the most important function of taxes, which serve as the primary 
means for financing public goods such as maintenance of law and order and 
public infrastructure. Assuming a certain level of revenue that needs to be 
raised, which depends on the broader economic and fiscal policies of the 
country concerned, there are a number of broad tax policy considerations 
that have traditionally guided the development of taxation systems. These 
include neutrality, efficiency, certainty and simplicity, effectiveness and 
fairness, as well as flexibility. In the context of work leading up to the Report 
on the Taxation of Electronic Commerce (see Annex A for further detail), 
these overarching principles were the basis for the 1998 Ottawa Ministerial 
Conference, and are since then referred to as the Ottawa Taxation Framework 
Conditions. At the time, these principles were deemed appropriate for an 
evaluation of the taxation issues related to e-commerce. Although most of 
the new business models identified in Chapter 4 did not exist yet at the time, 
these principles, with modification, continue to be relevant in the digital 
economy, as discussed in Chapter 8. In addition to these well-recognised 
principles, equity is an important consideration for the design of tax policy.
• Neutrality: Taxation should seek to be neutral and equitable 
between forms of business activities. A neutral tax will contribute 
to efficiency by ensuring that optimal allocation of the means 
of production is achieved. A distortion, and the corresponding 
deadweight loss, will occur when changes in price trigger different 
changes in supply and demand than would occur in the absence of 
tax. In this sense, neutrality also entails that the tax system raises 
revenue while minimising discrimination in favour of, or against, 
any particular economic choice. This implies that the same principles 
of taxation should apply to all forms of business, while addressing 
specific features that may otherwise undermine an equal and neutral 
application of those principles.
• Efficiency: Compliance costs to business and administration costs 
for governments should be minimised as far as possible.
• Certainty and simplicity: Tax rules should be clear and simple to 
understand, so that taxpayers know where they stand. A simple tax 
system makes it easier for individuals and businesses to understand 
their obligations and entitlements. As a result, businesses are more 
likely to make optimal decisions and respond to intended policy 
choices. Complexity also favours aggressive tax planning, which may 
trigger deadweight losses for the economy.
ADDRESSING THE TAX CHALLENGES OF THE DIGITAL ECONOMY © OECD 2014
2. FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF TAXATION – 31
• Effectiveness and fairness: Taxation should produce the right 
amount of tax at the right time, while avoiding both double taxation 
and unintentional non-taxation. In addition, the potential for 
evasion and avoidance should be minimised. Prior discussions in 
the Technical Advisory Groups (TAGs) considered that if there is 
a class of taxpayers that are technically subject to a tax, but are 
never required to pay the tax due to inability to enforce it, then the 
taxpaying public may view the tax as unfair and ineffective. As 
a result, the practical enforceability of tax rules is an important 
consideration for policy makers. In addition, because it influences 
the collectability and the administerability of taxes, enforceability is 
crucial to ensure efficiency of the tax system.
• Flexibility: Taxation systems should be flexible and dynamic 
enough to ensure they keep pace with technological and commercial 
developments. It is important that a tax system is dynamic and 
flexible enough to meet the current revenue needs of governments 
while adapting to changing needs on an ongoing basis. This means 
that the structural features of the system should be durable in a 
changing policy context, yet flexible and dynamic enough to allow 
governments to respond as required to keep pace with technological 
and commercial developments, taking into account that future 
developments will often be difficult to predict.
Equity is also an important consideration within a tax policy framework. 
Equity has two main elements; horizontal equity and vertical equity. 
Horizontal equity suggests that taxpayers in similar circumstances should 
bear a similar tax burden. Vertical equity is a normative concept, whose 
definition can differ from one user to another. According to some, it suggests 
that taxpayers in better circumstances should bear a larger part of the tax 
burden as a proportion of their income. In practice, the interpretation of 
vertical equity depends on the extent to which countries want to diminish 
income variation and whether it should be applied to income earned in 
a specific period or to lifetime income. Equity is traditionally delivered 
through the design of the personal tax and transfer systems.
Equity may also refer to inter-nation equity. As a theory, inter-nation 
equity is concerned with the allocation of national gain and loss in the 
international context and aims to ensure that each country receives an 
equitable share of tax revenues from cross-border transactions (OECD, 
2001). The tax policy principle of inter-nation equity has been an important 
consideration in the debate on the division of taxing rights between source 
and residence countries. At the time of the Ottawa work on the taxation of 
electronic commerce, this important concern was recognised by stating that 
“any adaptation of the existing international taxation principles should be

32 – 2. FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF TAXATION
structured to maintain fiscal sovereignty of countries, […] to achieve a fair 
sharing of the tax base from electronic commerce between countries…” 
(OECD, 2001: 228).
Tax policy choices often reflect decisions by policy makers on the relative 
importance of each of these principles and will also reflect wider economic 
and social policy considerations outside the field of tax.

USER REQUEST:
Summarize the five overarching principles of tax policy.","The five overarching principles of tax policy are:
*   **Neutrality**: Taxation should be neutral and equitable across different forms of business activities, contributing to efficiency by ensuring optimal allocation of production means. It aims to raise revenue while minimizing discrimination for or against any specific economic choice, applying the same principles to all businesses while addressing specific features that might undermine equal application (2.1 Overarching principles of tax policy).
*   **Efficiency**: This principle requires that compliance costs for businesses and administration costs for governments are minimized as much as possible (2.1 Overarching principles of tax policy).
*   **Certainty and simplicity**: Tax rules should be clear and simple, allowing taxpayers to understand their obligations and entitlements. A simple system helps businesses make optimal decisions and respond to policy choices, and reduces opportunities for aggressive tax planning (2.1 Overarching principles of tax policy).
*   **Effectiveness and fairness**: Taxation should generate the correct amount of tax at the appropriate time, preventing both double taxation and unintentional non-taxation. It also seeks to minimize evasion and avoidance, with practical enforceability being a key consideration for policy makers, as lack of enforcement can lead to public perception of unfairness and ineffectiveness (2.1 Overarching principles of tax policy).
*   **Flexibility**: Taxation systems should be dynamic and flexible enough to adapt to technological and commercial developments. They must meet current revenue needs while continuously adapting to changing requirements, ensuring structural durability in a changing policy context (2.1 Overarching principles of tax policy).","Tax systems are built upon several key principles designed to make them effective, fair, and adaptable. When governments are looking to raise revenue to fund public services, these ""overarching principles of tax policy"" guide their decisions. The document outlines five main principles, often referred to as the Ottawa Taxation Framework Conditions, which are crucial for evaluating and designing tax systems, especially in dynamic environments like the digital economy.

Here's a summary of these five principles:

1.  **Neutrality:** This principle suggests that taxation should be neutral and equitable across different types of business activities. Essentially, it means that the tax system shouldn't favor or disadvantage one economic choice over another. A neutral tax system helps ensure that resources are allocated efficiently, minimizing distortions in supply and demand that taxes can create. It aims to apply the same core principles to all businesses, while still being able to address specific characteristics that might otherwise undermine an equal application.
2.  **Efficiency:** The goal here is to keep costs down. This means minimizing the burden on businesses when they comply with tax rules (compliance costs) and minimizing the costs for governments to administer the tax system (administration costs). An efficient tax system saves time and resources for everyone involved.
3.  **Certainty and Simplicity:** Tax rules should be clear, straightforward, and easy for everyone to understand. When taxpayers—both individuals and businesses—know exactly what their obligations and entitlements are, they can make better decisions. A simple system also discourages aggressive tax planning, which can lead to economic inefficiencies.
4.  **Effectiveness and Fairness:** This principle has a few facets. Firstly, it means that the tax system should collect the correct amount of tax at the right time, preventing both situations where tax is paid twice (double taxation) and where no tax is paid at all unintentionally (unintentional non-taxation). Secondly, it aims to minimize opportunities for tax evasion and avoidance. For a tax to be considered fair and effective, it must be practically enforceable; if a tax is technically due but cannot be collected, it undermines public trust and makes the system seem unfair.
5.  **Flexibility:** Given how quickly technology and commerce evolve, tax systems need to be dynamic and flexible enough to keep pace. This ensures that the system can meet current revenue needs while also adapting to future changes, many of which can be difficult to predict. The structural features of the tax system should be durable yet adaptable to new developments.

In addition to these five, the document also highlights **Equity** as another vital consideration, encompassing horizontal equity (taxpayers in similar situations pay similar taxes), vertical equity (those with greater ability to pay bear a larger tax burden), and inter-nation equity (fair sharing of tax revenues from cross-border transactions among countries). Tax policy often involves balancing these various principles, as policymakers weigh their relative importance alongside broader economic and social goals."

**Robotics Sensors and Actuators**

Robot Sensors

• Sensors are devices that can sense and measure
physical properties of the environment,
• e.g. temperature, luminance, resistance to touch, weight,
size, etc.
• The key phenomenon is transduction
• Transduction (engineering) is a process that converts one
type of energy to another
• They deliver low-­‐level information about the
environment the robot is working in.
– Return an incomplete description of the world

• This information is noisy (imprecise).
• Cannot be modelled completely:
– Reading = f(env) where f is the model of the sensor
– Finding the inverse:
• ill posed problem (solution not uniquely deEined)
• collapsing of dimensionality leads to ambiguity

Types of Sensor

• General classification:
– active versus passive
• Active: emit energy in environment
– More robust, less efEicient
• Passive: passively receive energy from env.
– Less intrusive, but depends on env. e.g. light for camera
• Example: stereo vision versus range Einder.
– contact versus non-­‐contact

Sensors

• Proprioceptive Sensors
(monitor state of robot)
– IMU (accels & gyros)
– Wheel encoders
– Doppler radar …
• Exteroceptive Sensors
(monitor environment)
– Cameras (single, stereo, omni,
FLIR …)
– Laser scanner
– MW radar
– Sonar
– Tactile…

Sensor Characteristics

All sensors are characterized by various
properties that describe their capabilities
– Sensitivity:
(change of output) ÷ (change of input)
– Linearity: constancy of (output ÷ input)
• Exception: logarithmic response cameras ==
wider dynamic range.
– Measurement/Dynamic range:
difference between min. and max.

Response Time: time required for a change
in input to cause a change in the output
– Accuracy: difference between measured &
actual
– Repeatability: difference between repeated
measures
– Resolution: smallest observable increment
– Bandwidth: result of high resolution or cycle
time

Types of Sensor

Specific examples
– tactile
– close-­‐range proximity
– angular position
– infrared
– Sonar
– laser (various types)
– radar
– compasses, gyroscopes
– Force
– GPS
– vision

Tactile Sensors
 There are many different technologies
– e.g. contact closure, magnetic, piezoelectric, etc.
• For mobile robots these can be classiEied as
– tactile feelers (antennae) often some form of metal wire
passing through a wire loop -­‐ can be active (powered to
mechanically search for surfaces)
§ tactile bumpers
solid bar / plate acts on some form of contact switch
e.g. mirror deElecting light beam, pressure bladder,
wire loops, etc.
§ Pressure-­‐sensitive rubber with scanning
array
Vibrassae/whiskers of rats
– Surface texture information.
– Distance of deElection.
– Blind people using a cane.

Proximity Sensors
Tactile sensors allow obstacle detection
– proximity sensors needed for true obstacle
avoidance
• Several technologies can detect the presence of
particular Eields without mechanical contact
– magnetic reed switches
• two thin magnetic strips of opposite polarity not
quite touching
• an external magnetic Eield closes the strip &
makes contact
Hall effect sensors
• small voltage generated across a conductor
carrying current
– inductive sensors, capacitive sensors
• inductive sensors can detect presence of metallic
objects
• capacitive sensors can detect metallic or
dielectric materials

Infrared Sensors
Infrared sensors are probably the simplest type of non-­contact sensor
– widely used in mobile robotics to avoid obstacles
• They work by
– emitting infrared light
• to differentiate emitted IR from ambient IR (e.g. lights, sun,
etc.), the signal is modulated with a low frequency (100 Hz)
– detecting any reElections off nearby surfaces
• In certain environments, with careful calibration, IR
sensors can be used for measuring the distance to the
object
– requires uniform surface colours and structures

Infrared Sensors (Sharp)
Measures the return angle of the infrared beam.

Infrared Problems
If the IR signal is detected, it is safe to assume that an
object is present
• However, the absence of reElected IR does not mean that
no object is present!
– “Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.”
C. Sagan
– certain dark colours (black) are almost invisible to IR
– IR sensors are not absolutely safe for object detection
• In realistic situations (different colours & types of
objects) there is no accurate distance information
– it is best to avoid objects as soon as possible
• IR are short range
– typical maximum range is 50 to 100 cm

Sonar Sensors
• The fundamental principle of robot sonar sensors is the same as
that used by bats
– emit a chirp (e.g. 1.2 milliseconds)
• a short powerful pulse of a range of frequencies of sound
– its reElection off nearby surfaces is detected
• As the speed of sound in air is known (≈ 330 m·s-­‐1) the distance to
the object can be computed from the elapsed time between chirp
and echo
– minimum distance = 165 tchirp (e.g. 21 cm at 1.2 ms)
– maximum distance = 165 twait (e.g. 165 m at 1 s)
• Usually referred to as ultrasonic sensors

Sonar Problems
• There are a number of problems and uncertainties
associated with readings from sonar sensors
– it is difEicult to be sure in which direction an object is
because the 3D sonar beam spreads out as it travels
– specular re5lections give rise to erroneous readings
• the sonar beam hits a smooth surface at a shallow angle and so
reElects away from the sensor
• only when an object further away reElects the beam back does
the sensor obtain a reading -­‐ but distance is incorrect
– arrays of sonar sensors can experience crosstalk
• one sensor detects the reElected beam of another sensor
– the speed of sound varies with air temp. and pressure
• a 16° C temp. change can cause a 30cm error at 10m

Laser Range Finders
• Laser range Einders commonly used to measure the
distance, velocity and acceleration of objects
– also known as laser radar or lidar
• The operating principle is the same as sonar
– a short pulse of (laser) light is emitted
– the time elapsed between emission and detection is
used to determine distance (using the speed of light)
• Due to the shorter wavelengths of lasers, the chance of
specular reElections is much less
– accuracies of millimetres (16 -­‐ 50mm) over 100m
– 1D beam is usually swept to give a 2D planar beam
• May not detect transparent surfaces (e.g. glass!) or dark
objects 

RADAR
• Radar usually uses electromagnetic energy in the 1 -­‐
12.5 GHz frequency range
– this corresponds to wavelengths of 30 cm -­‐ 2 cm
• microwave energy
– unaffected by fog, rain, dust, haze and smoke
• It may use a pulsed time-­‐of-­‐Elight methodology of
sonar and lidar, but may also use other methods
– continuous-­‐wave phase detection
– continuous-­‐wave frequency modulation
• Continuous-­‐wave systems make use of Doppler effect
to measure relative velocity of the target

Angular Position: Rotary Encoder
• Potentiometer
– Used in the Servo on the boebots
• Optical Disks (Relative)
– Counting the slots
– Direction by having pars of emitters/receivers out of
phase: Quadrature decoding
– Can spin very fast: 500 kHz
• Optical Disks (Absolute)
– Grey encoding for absolute:
• 0:0000, 1:1000, 2:1100, 3:0100, 4:0110,
• 5:1110, 6:1010, 7:0010, 8:0011
• 9:1011, 10:1111, 11:0111, 12:0101, 13:1101, 14:1001,
15:0001

Compass Sensors
• Compass sensors measure the horizontal
component of the earth’s magnetic Eield
– some birds use the vertical component too
• The earth’s magnetic Eield is very weak and
non-­‐uniform, and changes over time
– indoors there are likely to be many other Eield
sources
• steel girders, reinforced concrete, power lines,
motors, etc.
– an accurate absolute reference is unlikely, but the
Eield is approx. constant, so can be used for local
reference

Gyroscopes
• A gyroscope is a spinning wheel with most of its mass
concentrated in the outer periphery
– e.g. a bicycle wheel
• Due to the law of conservation of momentum
– the spinning wheel will stay in its original orientation
– a force is required to rotate the gyroscope
• A gyro. can thus be used to maintain orientation or to
measure the rate and direction of rotation
• In fact there are different types of mechanical gyro.
– and even optical gyro’s with no moving parts!
• these can be used in e.g. space probes to maintain
orientation 

Ring Gyro's
• Use standing waves set up
– between mirrors (laser ring gyro)
– within a Eiber optic cable (Eibre optic ring gyro)
• Measure rotation by observing beats in standing
wave as the mirrors ""rotate through it"".

IMU's
• Gyro, accelerometer combination.
• Typical designs (e.g. 3DM-­‐GX1™)
use tri-­‐axial gyros to track
dynamic orientation and tri-­‐axial
DC accelerometers along with the
tri-­‐axial magnetometers to track
static orientation.
• The embedded microprocessors
contains programmable Eilter
algorithms, which blend these
static and dynamic responses in
real-­‐time.

GPS
• GPS uses a constellation of between 24 and 32
Medium Earth Orbit satellites.
• Satellite broadcast their position + time.
• Use travel time of 4 satellites and trilateration.
• Suffers from “canyon” effect in cities.

WiFi
• Using the SSID and database.

Odor Sensing
Smell is ubiquitous in nature
… both as a active and a passive sensor.
Why is it so important?

Scarlet Fever This leaflet offers more information about Scarlet Fever. If you have any further questions or concerns, please speak to the staff member in charge of your child’s care. What is Scarlet Fever?  Scarlet Fever is a bacterial infection that affects children.  It is caused by the streptococcus bacteria which are found in our throats and on our skin.  Scarlet Fever is easily treated with antibiotics. If antibiotic treatment is started early, the chance of children developing complications is rare. What are the signs and symptoms? • Sore throat • Flushed cheeks • Red, swollen tongue • Fever • Typical red, rough (sandpaper) rash appears a couple of days after the sore throat.  The rash often starts on the chest and stomach before spreading to the rest of the body. Does my child need any tests to confirm the diagnosis? The doctor will usually be able to diagnose scarlet fever by seeing the typical rash and hearing what symptoms your child has. A swab from your child’s throat may be taken. This will be sent to the laboratory to see if the streptococcus bacteria grow. Your doctor may start treatment while waiting for the result of this swab. What treatments are available? Scarlet fever is easily treated with antibiotics. Liquid penicillin is often used to treat children. These must be taken for seven days, even though most people get better after four to five days. Your child will still be infectious for 24 hours after antibiotic treatment has started and they shouldn't attend nursery or school during this period. What happens if I do not get treatment? Without antibiotic treatment, your child will be infectious for one to two weeks after they became unwell. Rare, but serious complications (rheumatic fever, pneumonia and sepsis) are more likely to occur if antibiotics are not taken. Is there anything I can do to help my child? • Encourage them to drink a lot • Give paracetamol for fever if your child is upset • Use calamine lotion to soothe itchy skin. How to prevent spread? • Encourage coughing and sneezing into tissues and wash hands after sneezing and coughing • Keep children off school for 24 hours after starting antibiotics (or two weeks if antibiotics are not used) • Avoid sharing bed linen, towels, clothes, drinks with people with scarlet fever.

What should I know about treatments for Scarlet Fever?","Scarlet Fever is easily treated with antibiotics (Scarlet Fever, What treatments are available?). Liquid penicillin is often used to treat children and must be taken for seven days, even though most people get better after four to five days (What treatments are available?). If antibiotic treatment is started early, the chance of children developing complications is rare (Scarlet Fever).

Without antibiotic treatment, serious complications such as rheumatic fever, pneumonia, and sepsis are more likely to occur (What happens if I do not get treatment?).

Children will remain infectious for 24 hours after antibiotic treatment has started and should not attend nursery or school during this period (What treatments are available?).

To help a child with Scarlet Fever, encourage them to drink a lot, give paracetamol for fever if the child is upset, and use calamine lotion to soothe itchy skin (Is there anything I can do to help my child?).","It's good to be informed about Scarlet Fever treatments, especially since it's a common childhood illness! Here's a breakdown of what you should know:

The good news is that **Scarlet Fever is easily treated with antibiotics**. This is the primary and most important treatment.

Here are the key details:

*   **Antibiotics are essential:** The infection is caused by streptococcus bacteria, and antibiotics like **liquid penicillin** are typically prescribed to get rid of it.
*   **Full course is crucial:** Even if your child starts feeling better after a few days (often 4-5 days), it's vital to complete the full **seven-day course** of antibiotics. This ensures the infection is completely cleared and helps prevent serious complications.
*   **Infectious period:** Your child will still be infectious for the first **24 hours after starting antibiotic treatment**. During this time, they should stay home from nursery or school to prevent spreading the infection.
*   **Why treatment is so important:** Without antibiotic treatment, your child will remain infectious for much longer (one to two weeks) and, more importantly, they face a higher risk of developing rare but serious complications like **rheumatic fever, pneumonia, and sepsis**.

Beyond antibiotics, there are also things you can do to help your child feel more comfortable and manage their symptoms:

*   **Stay hydrated:** Encourage your child to **drink plenty of fluids**.
*   **Manage fever:** If your child is uncomfortable or upset due to a fever, you can give them **paracetamol** (following dosage instructions, of course).
*   **Soothe itchy skin:** The characteristic ""sandpaper"" rash can be itchy. **Calamine lotion** can be used to help soothe the skin.

Remember, if you have any concerns or questions about your child's care, always speak to a healthcare professional!"

guidelines. In the first 6 months, when the risk of sudden infant death
syndrome (SIDS) is at its highest, the safest place for a baby to sleep is on
their back in their own sleep space, be that a cot, crib or moses basket.

A bedside crib fastens to the frame of your bed on one side, so you're
effectively lying next to your baby. The side can usually be dropped down
so you can see and reach over to your child. They're sometimes referred
to as side-sleepers or co-sleepers, but the key difference is that you're not
sharing a sleep surface or bedding. You and your baby can maximise the
soothing benefits that proximity brings while minimising the risks
associated with bed sharing. Having your baby at arm's reach also makes
night feeds much easier.

What is the new safety standard for bedside cribs?
All new bedside cribs manufactured since November 2020 have to meet a
new safety standard (with the catchy name BS EN 1130:2019) that
introduced new and more rigorous safety requirements for bedside cribs.
However, you may find some older versions of cribs are still on sale that
only match the previous safety standard. Slowly these will disappear from
stores and the only ones available will meet the new standard.
The most significant new requirement for BS EN 1130:2019 is for a 120mm

Best bedside crib for one-handed operation: Joie Roomie GO, £180 •

•
high barrier to be present around the sides of the crib, to ensure your
baby is not able to roll off their own mattress onto yours. This means that
new bedside cribs can no longer have complete drop-down sides – many
now have 'half-height' walls instead.
This allows your baby to be positioned next to you with the crib lined up to
your bed, but their mattress will be sunk a little lower, providing more of a
protective barrier. All the cribs featured in our list comply with these new
BS EN 1130:2019 safety requirements.
What to look for when buying a bedside crib
Will it work with your bed? – Certain bed frames can be trickier to use
with a bedside crib. For example, if you have a divan bed you will need
longer straps, and may not be able to tuck the legs of the crib underneath
the bed and may need to look for a model that has foldable legs or works
with your bed style.
Height of your bed – Most bedside cribs have adjustable heights to give
you an almost perfect fit on most bed frames, but if your bed is
particularly low or high, do check the measurements. Also check the size
of the crib and whether it will fit next to your bed while allowing you to get
in and out easily and safely. This is particularly important for those first
few days and weeks after giving birth when your body is still recovering.
Mattress – The mattress needs to be firm, flat and breathable – this is a
key safety feature. Don’t be tempted by a super soft mattress – your baby
will sleep deeply and most importantly safely on a firm mattress.
Drop-down side – How easy is it to remove the side? Can you do it with
one hand? As you may be doing this in the middle of the night, are there
lots of noisy zips and clips? Can it safely be left down while you sleep? Do
check this as the rules differ depending on the product.
How easy is it to assemble – Are there lots of parts to screw together? Will
you need 2 people to build it? We’ve tested how easy different bedside
cribs are to build in our reviews.
How easy is it to keep clean – Does the mattress have a waterproof cover
to protect from leaky nappies, baby sick and dribbles? Is the fabric
machine washable or will you have to hand wash it?
Portability – Is the crib light enough to move around your house? If you
want to take it away with you does it crib fold flat and/or come with a
storage bag?
Extra features – Does it rock (useful for fussy sleepers), tilt (remember to
use tilting with care), detach to become a moses basket or turn into an
older baby cot or playpen? These extra features may not be necessary, but
they could be useful.
For more safety information we've also covered breathability, bedding and
how to use the tilting function here.
What are the benefits of using a bedside crib?
Safe sleep charity The Lullaby Trust, advises that the safest place for your
baby to sleep is on their own sleep surface, in the same room as you, for
at least the first 6 months. Bedside cribs allow you to have your baby
sleeping right next to you at night, but in the safety of their own crib. This
means you can still be close to your baby without bed-sharing, which
carries a risk of suffocation and overheating.
Bedside cribs enable you to lean over and easily pick up your baby when
feeding at night. This is especially useful if you’ve had a difficult birth or a
c-section and find getting out of bed painful. You can also easily comfort
your baby if they are fussing and have a good view of them while they are
sleeping.
How to do the baby mattress firmness test
Press your hand on the centre and the sides of the mattress •
A firm mattress shouldn’t mould to the shape of your hand and
you’ll feel resistance – it will obviously move beneath the
pressure but your hand shouldn’t sink in
•
When you remove your hand, the mattress should snap back
and regain its shape
•
From a practical perspective, bedside cribs are smaller and more compact
than most cots, which means they take up less space in your bedroom
than a full-sized cot or cotbed.
Do I need a bedside crib for my baby?
You don’t have to buy a bedside crib. It's completely safe to put a baby in a
regular cot from birth. But they’re a great option if you want your baby as
close to you as possible at night, and for saving space. The downside is
that most of these cribs only last up to 6 months and you’ll then need to
move your baby into a full-sized cot or cotbed. A moses basket is a more
economical option, but these can last even less time, and do not have the
added features of a bedside crib such as a drop-down side, tilt, or multiple
heights.
How much does a bedside crib cost?
It is possible to buy budget bedside cribs for under £100 but the majority
we have reviewed are between £150-£300. Certain features, such as a
rocking function or one-handed drop down side, tend to push the price up
slightly.
How did we choose these bedside cribs?
Our 10 of the Best lists are compiled by qualified and experienced
parenting journalists. They rely on a number of sources, including our
independent reviews, testing undertaken during the MadeForMums
Awards, and feedback from our home testing panel and Top Testers
Club. Each year thousands of products are put through their paces by
hundreds of parents across the country on behalf of MadeForMums,
to ensure we’re bringing you honest and true reviews and
recommendations.
When testing bedside cribs, we consider size, ease of build and fitting,
mattress quality and breathability, ease and safety of the drop-down
side mechanism and other features, comfort for baby, design and
quality, and whether it's worth the money.
Our list is not an ordered ranking from 1-10, instead it is a carefully
Here are our top 10 bedside cribs for 2024
1. Chicco Next2Me Magic, £189
– Best for easy drop-down side
Suitable from: Birth to 6 months/9kg | Weight: 13.1kg | Crib size: H66.5-
82.4cm x W73cm x L99.5cm | Mattress size: L83cm x W50.5cm | Tilt: Yes
| Rocks: Yes | Height positions: 11 | Washable mattress cover: Hand
wash
The Chicco Next2Me Magic is the latest update to the original Next2Me
side-sleeping crib, which has won fans for its versatility. It can be used
from birth as a bedside co-sleeper, as a standalone crib or possibly as a
travel cot, but at over 13kg it's not a light carry.
It is slightly more expensive than some other models, but standout
features include a really easy drop-side that can be operated with one
hand, 11 height levels, a lockable rocking function, 4 tilt options to help
reduce reflux, and wheels to make it easy to move around your home.
selected group of tried-and-tested products, each of which we believe
is best for a different situation or requirement. We don’t just tell you
what is best, we help you discover what is best for your family.
A large sleeping area means more room for a bigger baby, plus a travel
bag is included.
MFM tester Lucy said, “I found the Chicco Next2Me Magic a breeze to
move around and set up, but also substantial and sturdy. The clever onehanded drop-down mechanism on the side panel can be used while
holding your baby in your arms, which is brilliant.
""I've even used the Chicco in my kitchen for safe day naps when I need to
be more focused on my older child.”
Pros: Firm and breathable mattress, retractable legs to fit any bed, quiet
side zip, easy to transport
Cons: Tricky to initially assemble, mattress cover is hand wash only

2. SnuzPod 4 Bedside Crib, £199.95
– Best for removable bassinet
Suitable from: Birth to 6 months/9kg | Weight: 11.5kg | Crib size: H95cm
x W49cm x L100cm | Mattress size: L75cm x W40cm | Tilt: Yes | Rocks:
Yes | Height positions: 7 | Washable mattress cover: Machine washable
The latest iteration of Snuz's much-loved bedside crib, the Snuzpod4
features a new breathable system (called ComfortAir) that aids the flow of
air around the crib and your baby. It offers more side vents, breathable
mesh liner and mattress, plus a ventilated base.
But the key thing that we're delighted to see is that the Snuzpod4 has a
firmer mattress than previous versions – as well as good breathability.
Plus Snuz claims that the SnuzPod4 fits more bed heights than any rival, as
it will now work with beds up to a maximum adult mattress height of
73cm. It's also designed to be compatible with a range of bed types –
divan, ottoman and framed bed bases.
Made from sustainably sourced beech solid wood, the Snuzpod4 looks
good. MFM mum home tester Mehack commented on ""how stylish and
contemporary the design is,"" praising how it ""fits perfectly with the room
decor"".
We love its versatility – the two-part design includes a lift-off bassinet that
can be moved around the house so you have a portable safe sleeping
space for your baby, whichever room you're in. The bassinet also has a
manual rocking function, as does the crib and the bassinet. There's an
optional riser that can be added to create a slight incline to help babies
with reflux, but for safety reasons, when the cot is tilted this stops the
rocking function from working.
Pros: Stylish, removable bassinet, great storage
Cons: Can be difficult to put together

3. Tutti Bambini CoZee Air Bedside Crib, £225
– Best for smooth rocking
Suitable from: Birth to 6 months/9kg | Weight: 11kg | Crib size: H92cm x
W12cm x L56cm | Mattress size: L80.5cm x W51cm | Tilt: Yes | Rocks: Yes
| Height positions: 6 | Washable mattress cover: Sponge, only machine
wash if necessary
While it is at the more expensive end of the market, what makes the
CoZee Air stand out from the competition is its smooth rocking function. It
comes with easy-to-remove caster wheels that you can switch with rocking
bars, which easily attach to the legs of the crib. As a safety feature, the
CoZee can also only be rocked when it is set up as a standalone crib –
when used as a bedside crib, it has flip-out feet that prevent it from doing
so. “The rocking feature is fantastic and really helped me to settle my baby
when she was overtired and fussing,” said MFM tester Tara.
MFM testers also rated the crib highly for its portability – it is ideal as a
travel cot, as despite its large size, it is compact when folded. A 30-second
open-fold mechanism allows for a quick set up and it comes with a travel
bag for easy transportation.
While the multiple mesh windows are great for breathability and being
able to see your little one, there's a curtain attached to one side of the crib
that you can roll down to protect your baby from draughts during colder
months. This still leaves one mesh side open to allow for plenty of air flow.
When it comes to cleaning, the fabric lining can be removed and put in the
washing machine, while the foam mattress can be machine washed if
necessary. We also like the addition of a storage shelf that is useful for
holding essentials such as baby wipes, nappies, clothes and muslins.
Pros: Smooth rocking, quick to collapse down, storage shelf
Cons: Higher price point

4. Shnuggle Air Bedside crib, £180
– Best for longevity
Suitable from: Birth to 6 months/9kg (up to 2 years with conversion kit) |
Weight: 13.4kg | Crib size: H68.5–83cm x W56cm x L94cm | Mattress size:
L83cm x W50cm | Tilt: Yes | Rocks: No | Height positions: 7 | Washable
mattress cover: Hand wash
While most bedside cribs on the market are only suitable for babies up to
6 months old, the Shnuggle Air stands out by offering 3 products in 1. It
can be used as a standalone cot or bedside sleeper and then it transforms
after 6 months into a full-sized cot when you buy the additional
conversion kit (£109.95) and cot mattress (£50), which will last your child
up until around 2 years old. This makes it a great long-term investment.
MFM judges and testers were particularly impressed with the firmness of
its hypo-allergenic airflow mattress. This crib has dual-view mesh sides,
giving it maximum breathability; this also means you can easily see your
baby when both sides are up. This was also a feature that stood out to
MFM reviewer Tara, who used it with her 6-month-old daughter Elodie.
She said, “Elodie slept very soundly and she loved being able to see
through the mesh sides.”
The drop-down sides are easily removed for nighttime access by releasing
the safety catch on the top bar and undoing the zips. However, during the
awards testing, it was noted that the safety catch makes a loud click. This
was echoed by a MFM user reviewer who said: “The side makes a noise
when you click it back in and that can wake up baby!” Unlike most of the
others on this list, the side of the Shnuggle Air cannot be left down during
sleep, it's simply there for access.
The Shnuggle Air is relatively heavy at 13.4kg, and doesn't have wheels, so
it's not easy to move around your home. “I’d say once the Shnuggle Air is
set up, it’s staying put,” Tara added.
Pros: Long-lasting, highly breathable, spacious
Cons: Not easily portable, side is noisy when released, hand wash only

5. Maxi-Cosi Iora bedside sleeper, £149
– Best for extra storage
Suitable from: Birth to 6 months/9kg | Weight: 10.8kg | Crib size:
H74.5cm x W55.5cm x L93cm | Mattress size: L80cm x W58.5cm | Tilt: Yes
| Rocks: No | Height positions: 5 | Washable mattress cover: Hand wash
With its choice of muted colours, sleek design and quality materials, the
Maxi-Cosi Iora is sure to fit in with most room schemes. The large storage
basket at the bottom of the crib is great for parents who are short on
space as it can easily hold numerous blankets, baby sleeping bags,
nappies, wipes and spare clothes.
The Iora’s easy-to-adjust height (5 positions in total) and slide function (2
positions in total) also means it can fit snugly against most types of bed
when used with the straps. “Our iron-frame bed is somewhat lower than
average,” said MFM reviewer Georgina. “But the Iora also sat in the correct
position with our mattress.”
One feature that our reviewer Georgina particularly liked was that when
the side is down, there is a 7-inch (18cm) barrier to stop your baby rolling
out. She said: “The Iora allowed me to sleep as close to my daughter as
possible, but I was also safe in the knowledge that she was in her own
sleeping area and I wasn't going to squash her!”
This crib is extremely straightforward to assemble (one of the quickest
during MFM testing) and MFM reviewer Georgina managed to put it
together speedily without using the instructions. She explained: “It was
obvious which pieces go together, simple to build and had neat zips to
keep everything in place.” A handy bag also means it can easily be used as
a travel cot, especially as it folds down flat. Keep in mind that Georgina did
find the outer fabric was prone to creasing when unpacked from the travel
bag.
Pros: Extra storage, easy height and slide adjustments, portable, smart
appearance
Cons: Mattress cover hand wash only, outer fabric prone to creasing, not
as many height options as other cribs, only mesh on one side

– Best for one-handed operation
Suitable from: Birth to 6 months/9kg | Weight: 9.5kg | Crib size: H74.8-
82.2cm x W68.5cm x L90.3cm | Mattress size: H6cm x W51cm x L84cm |
Tilt: Yes | Rocks: No | Height positions: 5 | Washable mattress cover:
Machine washable | Awards: Gold – Bedside/Co-Sleeper Crib,
MadeForMum Awards 2023
Awarded Gold in Best Bedside/Co-Sleeper Crib, MadeForMums Awards
2023, the Joie Roomie Go packs in a lot of features for its mid-range price.
Offering mesh windows on both sides, providing plenty of ventilation as
well as making it easy to keep an eye on your baby, the stylish crib is
available in a choice of chic grey or classic black. Our MFM home testers
were impressed with the Roomie Go’s aesthetic, with one commenting, “It
looks great, is made with good quality material and will look stylish in any
room.”
The one-handed drop-down panels on both sides of the crib mean you
can easily switch which side of the bed you attach it to. You should be able
to simply click the handle to lift and lower, although one of our home
testers commented that the first couple of times they attempted this the
mechanism was a little sticky.
Its simple, compact fold means you can pack the crib away in less than a
minute and take it with you in the travel bag included, for holidays or trips
to the grandparents’.
The Joie Roomie Go is also on (lockable) wheels so you can move it around
the home during the daytime. It has a tummy tilt for reflux/colic, and there
are 5 height adjustments to fit most beds. Praised across the board by our
MFM home testers for its comfy mattress and ease of assembly, it’s a great
all-rounder both when at home and away.
Pros: One-handed operation, tilt function for reflux, comfortable for baby,
drop-down panels on both sides, travel bag included
Cons: No storage, not as many height options as other cribs

7. Red Kite Cozysleep Crib, £84.99
– Best for value
Suitable from: Birth to 6 months/9kg | Weight: 9kg | Crib size: H74-87cm
x W57-61cm x L88cm | Mattress size: W80cm x L50cm | Tilt: Yes | Rocks:
No | Height positions: 7 | Washable mattress cover: No, wipeable only |
Awards: Silver – Bedside/Co-Sleeper Crib, MadeForMum Awards 2023
Coming in at just under £85 the Red Kite Cozysleep crib offers really
fantastic value. However, the great price doesn't mean there's a
compromise on features or style. “It’s a well-made product that looks
modern and would easily suit all bedrooms,” said MFM home tester Kiran,
who appreciated the simple, yet contemporary look.
The crib has a drop-down side, 7 adjustable height positions, a tilt function
(great for helping with reflux) and a handy storage shelf for things like
nappies and wipes. It's on wheels, so it can be moved around the room or
away from the bed with ease, and it also folds down to a more compact
size for travel. There’s even a handy storage bag included, which our
testers felt helps you to get even more use out of the Cozysleep as a travel
cot.
One feature that really impressed our home testers was the quality of the
soft, quilted mattress, with one MFM home tester commenting, “The
mattress is brilliant! I have used other makes of co-sleepers/cribs and this
mattress is triple the thickness. It feels soft but firm and very comfy.”
Pros: Great value, tilt function, good quality mattress, handy storage shelf,
travel bag included
Cons: Only mesh on one side

8. Halo BassiNest Premiere Swivel Sleeper, £248.29
– Best for 360° swivel
Suitable from: Birth to 5 months/10kg | Weight: 14.8kg | Crib size:
H94cm x W61cm x L114cm | Mattress size: L85cm x W55.8cm | Tilt: No |
Rocks: Battery-powered vibrations | Height positions: Customisable
between 61cm-84cm | Washable mattress cover: Machine-washable
sheet included
This is American brand Halo's updated version of its popular BassiNest
Essentia swivel sleeper. Offering a slightly different way to sleep closely
but safely with your baby, the BassiNest Premiere is a standalone crib with
a central stand that slides beneath the bed, rather than fastening on to
the side of the bed.
Parents can then swivel the crib 360° for easy access, with one MFM home
tester pointing out this also ""makes it easy to get in and out of bed without
disturbing the baby"". There's no drop-down side, instead the mesh side
has enough give that you can push it down to reach and get your baby
before it automatically returns to the upright position.
Compared to cribs with open sides that sit flush with the bed, the
BassiNest is more of a hybrid product, sitting somewhere between a
moses basket and a bedside crib. While the BassiNest Premiere doesn't
have a rock or tilt function, it does have a built-in “soothing centre” that
features an amber nightlight, floorlight, 2 vibration levels and 4 soothing
sounds, all with auto shutoff. To use this function you will need 3 x AA
batteries (not included).
Pros: Flexible, useful when recovering from birth, customisable height to
fit most beds, built-in soothing centre
Cons: Not a true bedside crib, very heavy, need batteries to access the
soothing centre functions, expensive

How do you use a bedside crib safely?
The most important piece of advice for safe sleeping is to lie your baby on
their back to sleep. Indeed, since the Back To Sleep campaign was
launched in the UK 30 years ago, cases of SIDS (Sudden Infant Death
Syndrome) have fallen by 80%.
When using a bedside crib, you should ensure there is no gap between the
adult's and baby's mattress. Your baby’s mattress should be firm and flat,
and sit snugly in the crib with no gaps.
Also look for a mattress that is breathable. There's a simple test you can
do for this:
Most cribs come with a mattress as standard, but if you are given the crib
by someone else or buy one second-hand you will need to buy a new
mattress – even if the existing one appears to be in good condition.
Second-hand mattresses may increase the risk of SIDS and are less likely
to be supportive after losing their shape over time. Always use the
mattress designed to fit your bedside crib – most retailers sell them
separately should you need a replacement.
When it comes to a safe sleeping position, place your baby in the crib with
their feet at the end of the crib – called the feet-to-foot position. This
reduces the risk of their face or head slipping down under the covers if
you're using a blanket.
How to use tilting and rocking features safely
Some bedside cribs offer a tilt option, which may help babies with
digestive issues, colic or reflux. If you are going to tilt your baby, you must
do so with great care and only at a slight angle, to avoid your baby slipping
down. We recommend speaking to your GP or health visitor for advice
before using the tilt function.
Tilting (and rocking) can only be used when the bedside crib is set up as a

What bedding can I use with a bedside crib?
The Lullaby Trust advises, “Firmly tucked-in sheets and blankets (not above
shoulder height) or a baby sleep bag are safe for a baby to sleep in.” Make
sure you buy the correct size sheets that exactly fit your mattress. You
may also choose to swaddle a newborn. The Lullaby Trust does not advise
for or against swaddling, but it does have some basic swaddling guidance.
You must stop using a swaddle as soon as your baby learns to roll.
Not all baby sleeping bags and swaddles are created equal, so make sure
the brand you buy adheres to safety standards, is the correct tog for the
room temperature and season, and is the right size for your baby, so they
can't slip down inside.
Don’t use any soft or bulky bedding and never use pillows, duvets, baby
bumpers or baby positioners. You should also remove any soft toys from
the crib before your baby sleeps.

What is the best co sleeper for me and my new baby?","The provided document does not contain this information. The document states that its list of bedside cribs is ""not an ordered ranking from 1-10, instead it is a carefully selected group of tried-and-tested products, each of which we believe is best for a different situation or requirement"" (""How did we choose these bedside cribs?"").","Congratulations on your new baby! Choosing the right co-sleeper, also known as a bedside crib, is a wonderful way to keep your little one close and ensure safe sleep during those precious first few months.

The document highlights that there isn't one single ""best"" co-sleeper for everyone, as different families have different needs and preferences. Instead, it offers a fantastic breakdown of various top-rated models, each excelling in certain areas. The key is to find the one that best suits *your* specific situation.

Here's how to think about finding the best co-sleeper for you, along with some great options from the document:

### What is a Bedside Crib (Co-sleeper)?

First, it's important to clarify that when we talk about ""co-sleepers"" in this context, we're referring to **bedside cribs**. These are standalone sleep spaces for your baby that securely fasten to your bed, often with a drop-down side. This allows you to have your baby at arm's reach for comfort and night feeds, without sharing the same sleep surface or bedding, which is crucial for following safe sleep guidelines recommended by The Lullaby Trust. Bed-sharing carries risks like suffocation and overheating, so a bedside crib offers the best of both worlds – proximity and safety.

### Key Factors to Consider When Choosing:

To help you narrow down the options, consider these questions based on the document's advice:

1.  **Compatibility with your bed:** Do you have a divan bed, a framed bed, or an ottoman? Some cribs have retractable or foldable legs that work better with certain bed types. Also, check the height adjustability to ensure a snug fit with your mattress.
2.  **Mattress quality:** This is a huge safety feature! Look for a mattress that is firm, flat, and breathable. You should always buy a new mattress if getting a second-hand crib.
3.  **Drop-down side mechanism:** How easy is it to operate, especially with one hand in the middle of the night? Are there noisy zips or clips that might wake the baby?
4.  **Ease of assembly and cleaning:** Some cribs are quicker to build than others. For cleaning, check if the fabric is machine washable or if the mattress has a waterproof cover.
5.  **Portability:** Do you plan to move it between rooms or take it on trips? Look for lightweight models that fold compactly and come with a travel bag.
6.  **Extra features:** Do you want a rocking function, a tilt option for reflux, extra storage, or the ability to convert into a full-sized cot later on?
7.  **Budget:** Bedside cribs range from under £100 to over £300, with extra features often increasing the price.

### Top Bedside Cribs Highlighted in the Document:

Here are some excellent options, categorized by what they're ""best for"" to help you consider your priorities:

*   **Best for an Easy Drop-Down Side:** The **Chicco Next2Me Magic (£189)** is a popular choice for its one-handed drop-side operation, 11 height levels, and lockable rocking function. It's also quite versatile, usable as a standalone or travel cot (though a bit heavy).
*   **Best for a Removable Bassinet:** The **SnuzPod 4 Bedside Crib (£199.95)** features a lift-off bassinet that you can move around the house, providing a safe sleep space wherever you are. It also boasts excellent breathability and a firmer mattress than previous models.
*   **Best for Smooth Rocking:** If your baby loves to be soothed, the **Tutti Bambini CoZee Air Bedside Crib (£225)** offers a fantastic smooth rocking function (when used as a standalone crib). It's also highly portable with a quick 30-second fold and comes with a handy storage shelf.
*   **Best for Longevity:** The **Shnuggle Air Bedside Crib (£180)** is unique because it can convert into a full-sized cot (with an additional conversion kit) that lasts up to 2 years, making it a great long-term investment. It's also praised for its firm, hypoallergenic mattress and dual-view mesh sides.
*   **Best for Extra Storage:** The **Maxi-Cosi Iora Bedside Sleeper (£149)** comes with a large storage basket at the bottom, perfect for keeping nappies, wipes, and blankets close at hand. It's also very easy to assemble and portable.
*   **Best for One-Handed Operation:** The **Joie Roomie GO (£180)** is another great option for easy one-handed drop-down panels on both sides, making it versatile for either side of the bed. It's portable with a compact fold and includes a travel bag.
*   **Best Value:** The **Red Kite Cozysleep Bedside Crib (£84.99)** offers excellent features for its budget-friendly price, including a drop-down side, 7 height positions, a tilt function, and a storage shelf. It's also portable with wheels and a travel bag.
*   **Best for 360° Swivel:** The **Halo BassiNest Premiere Swivel Sleeper (£248.29)** is a bit different as a standalone crib with a central stand that swivels 360°. This allows for easy access and getting in and out of bed without disturbing your baby. It also has built-in soothing features like vibrations and sounds.

### Safety First!

Regardless of which one you choose, remember these crucial safety tips:

*   **New Safety Standards:** All new bedside cribs manufactured since November 2020 should meet the new BS EN 1130:2019 safety standard, which includes a 120mm high barrier to prevent your baby from rolling onto your mattress. All the cribs on the document's list comply with this.
*   **Mattress:** Always ensure the mattress is firm, flat, and breathable, fitting snugly in the crib with no gaps. If buying second-hand, always get a new mattress.
*   **Positioning:** Always place your baby on their back to sleep, with their feet at the end of the crib (feet-to-foot position) to prevent them from slipping under bedding.
*   **Bedding:** Use firmly tucked-in sheets and blankets (not above shoulder height) or a baby sleep bag. Never use pillows, duvets, bumpers, or soft toys in the crib.
*   **Tilting/Rocking:** If a crib has a tilt or rocking function, only use it when the crib is set up as a standalone unit, never when it's attached to your bed with the side down. Consult your GP or health visitor before using the tilt function.

To find your ""best"" co-sleeper, I recommend looking at these options and seeing which features align most with your lifestyle, bedroom space, and budget. Good luck with your search – you'll find a perfect spot for your new little one!"

Transatlantic Tech Bridge: Digital Infrastructure and Subsea Cables, a US Perspective
1. US strategic interests in digital infrastructure and its industrial policy
 The United States’ overarching strategic goal is an open, secure, interoperable and 
global internet, one where US digital leaders can compete (and win). This requires 
trusted digital infrastructure. US investment in digital infrastructure reveals 
both domestic and international priorities. The 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure 
Bill provides 65 billion US dollars for high-speed internet deployment.6 Its focus 
is on providing connectivity for low-income households through the Affordable 
Connectivity Program and reaching underserved rural, agricultural and tribal 
areas.7 The “Internet for All” initiative manages grants for infrastructure and 
training.8 In the international development space, digital infrastructure is one of 
three pillars of USAID’s digital strategy and its digital ecosystem framework.9
 US firms retain a leading position in the ownership of subsea cables, and along with 
Japanese and French firms continue to supply the equipment for most projects. 
Cables were traditionally owned by a consortium of telecom firms, but this model 
has seen its share diminish with the influx of cables owned by content providers 
(the hyperscalers). Unlike other digital technologies, the supply chain for the raw 
materials that make up the cables is not dependent on China.10 Global cooperation 
takes place through formats like the UN’s International Telecommunications 
Union and multistakeholder arrangements like the International Cable Protection
Committee. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) 
provides an important legal framework for ocean policy and undersea cables, 
including cable protection zones and a dispute resolution framework. The US, 
however, has failed to ratify UNCLOS for decades and even in the case of US 
ratification, credible enforcement would be difficult.11
Geopolitics and rising concerns about China have upended the world of subsea 
cables. Digital infrastructure, and undersea cables in particular, fit into a wider 
strategy for the US and are a key element of “outcompeting” China. This is leading 
to what has been dubbed a “subsea cold war”.12 Concerns are multifaceted and 
overlapping, including the physical security of infrastructure, espionage, economic 
competitiveness and support for domestic firms, fears of technology leakage and 
geopolitical competition. In promoting the view that “the digital backbones of the 
modern economy must be open, trusted, interoperable, reliable, and secure”,13 US 
strategy is highly focused on countering China’s “digital silk road”.
 Digital infrastructure is critical, but also a potential vector for insecurity and 
subject to disruptions, both accidental and deliberate. But attribution and assessing 
conflicting motivations among potential adversaries can be difficult. There is 
still significant uncertainty around cyberthreats and subsea cables, with limited 
publicly available information or attribution. The majority of cable faults – around 
a hundred per year – are attributable to accidental errors, such as damage from 
fishing vessels, or geologic incidents.14 But the risk and fear of state-directed cyber
attacks or physical sabotage is rising. Many examples remain hypothetical; and 
concrete details or attribution are classified or unknown. One of the few known 
events, a 2022 cyber-attack in Hawaii that the Department of Homeland Security 
claimed to have foiled, was merely attributed to an “international hacking group”.15 
Chinese ships have been accused of damaging cables in the Taiwan straits as part 
of a pressure campaign on the island.16
 The US is particularly concerned about potential for espionage from adversaries 
like China and Russia. Tapping into and filtering the enormous quantities of 
information on subsea cables is extremely difficult, especially at great depths,
and only a few countries likely have such capabilities. Landing stations where 
cables come ashore, however, have been identified as potential vulnerabilities, 
where lax security could allow for monitoring or tapping of the cables. The US can 
illustrate its concerns about growing control of infrastructure by adversaries by 
pointing to cases like the Federated States of Micronesia, where China pressured 
the government to grant it control of cables and telecom infrastructure via a 
Memorandum of Understanding.17 The point here is that Chinese infrastructure 
investments through the digital silk road will lead to de-facto control and facilitate 
espionage. Cost-reduction measures by cable owners have also led to increased 
deployment of remote network management systems, which introduce new 
vulnerabilities to hacking or sabotage since they are connected to the internet.18
 The US has responded to these concerns with legislation like the Secure and 
Trusted Communications Networks Act of 2019, which charged the Federal 
Communications Commission with carrying out the complex rip-and-replace 
process for Huawei-made infrastructure domestically.19 The US has also expressed 
concerns about Europe’s reliance on 5G infrastructure from Huawei.20 The National 
Security Strategy released in October 2022 warns that autocratic governments 
“leverage access to their markets and control of global digital infrastructure for 
coercive purposes” and cites China as a source of “untrusted digital infrastructure”.21
 The US has also acted to ensure continued market dominance by US and allied 
firms. Between 2015 and 2019, Chinese investments through the digital silk road 
led to control by Huawei Marine (which became HMN Tech in 2019) of about 15 
per cent of the global market.22 Sanctions were placed on HMN Tech in 2021, citing 
its “intention to acquire American technology to help modernize China’s People’s 
Liberation Army”.23 This issue also predates the current Biden Administration. 
In addition to sanctions placed on Huawei, President Trump’s “Executive Order 
on Establishing the Committee for the Assessment of Foreign Participation in 
the United States Telecommunications Services Sector” provided structure to 
an interagency team known as “Team Telecom” charged with reviewing foreign
investment in telecom and broadcast firms.24 Run by the Department of Justice’s 
National Security Division, it makes licensing recommendations to the Federal 
Communications Commission with the goal of ensuring that no cable directly 
connects the US and the Chinese mainland or Hong Kong.25 The US Congress has 
also been somewhat vocal on the issue. For example, the Undersea Cable Control 
Act passed the House in March 2023.26
 Recent years have therefore seen significant shifts in undersea cable investment, 
with many new cables rerouted to avoid China and the South China Sea.27 While 
warnings of an undersea splinternet may be exaggerated, the sector is nevertheless 
seeing important shifts in investment, particularly for transpacific cables. From 
2016 to 2020, 75 per cent of cables included at least one Chinese owner. Projections 
for 2021–2025 plummet to 0 per cent (see Figure 2). Significant reductions are 
apparent in other Asia connections as well.
The US government has also intervened in cases of Chinese involvement in 
infrastructure projects and exerted pressure which has led to cancellation of 
cable initiatives or contracts if awarded to Chinese firms. For example, a 2018 
proposed consortium led by Amazon, Meta and China Mobile met with opposition 
from Washington. US security concerns remained even following China Mobile’s 
departure, and the project was shelved despite much of the cable having already 
been laid.28 The 600 million US dollar SeaWeMe-6 cable connecting Singapore to 
France was awarded to the US’s SubCom over HMN Tech following diplomatic 
pressure and incentives like training grants to local telecom firms from the US 
Trade and Development Agency.29 At the same time, this pressure, along with 
sanctions, has influenced cable-building endeavours that do not include US 
investors or connect geographically to the US.30
 Such events illustrate the strategic competitive and economic interests at stake, 
as technology becomes a key site of geopolitical competition. In order to counter 
China, the United States is working to build a network of partnerships on digital 
infrastructure. The US CABLES programme provides capacity building and 
technical assistance to members of the Quad alliance in the Indo-Pacific.31 The 
Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) through the G7 aims 
to offer an alternative to China’s Belt and Road Investments,32 and included cables 
as part of a recent PGII announcement on the sidelines of the G20.33 The US also 
launched the Trilateral Partnership for Infrastructure Investment with Australia 
and Japan in 2018.34 The NATO undersea infrastructure coordination cell, launched 
in 2023, coordinates between military, civilian and industry interests in subsea 
infrastructure to increase security.35 The State Department’s 2020 Clean Network 
Initiative, whose scope extends beyond subsea cables, created a set of shared 
principles and practices for countries and companies with the goal of blocking 
Chinese market dominance.36

*   Preventing untrusted digital infrastructure, particularly from China, and autocratic governments from leveraging control of global digital infrastructure for coercive purposes (Transatlantic Tech Bridge: Digital Infrastructure and Subsea Cables, a US Perspective).","The United States has several key strategic goals concerning subsea cables, which are essentially the underwater internet cables that carry most of the world's digital data. In simple terms, these goals are all about ensuring a secure, open, and competitive digital future, especially in light of growing geopolitical competition.

Here's a breakdown:

1.  **Promoting a Trusted Global Internet:** The US wants an internet that is open, secure, and where everyone can connect easily (interoperable). This means having reliable digital infrastructure, including subsea cables, that isn't controlled by untrusted actors.
2.  **Maintaining US and Allied Leadership:** The US aims to ensure its own companies, and those of its allies (like Japan and France), remain leaders in owning and supplying equipment for these critical cables. They want to prevent adversaries from dominating this market.
3.  **Countering China's Influence:** A major focus is to ""outcompete"" China in the digital space. The US is actively working to counter China's ""digital silk road"" initiative, which it sees as a way for China to gain de-facto control over digital infrastructure and potentially facilitate espionage or coercive purposes. This has even led to a ""subsea cold war"" where cables are being rerouted to avoid China and Chinese firms are being sanctioned.
4.  **Ensuring Security and Preventing Espionage:** The US is highly concerned about the physical security of these cables, potential cyberattacks, and espionage. While most faults are accidental, there's a rising fear of state-directed attacks or sabotage. They also worry about vulnerabilities at ""landing stations"" where cables come ashore and the risks associated with remote network management systems. The goal is to prevent adversaries like China and Russia from tapping into or controlling these vital data pathways.
5.  **Supporting Domestic Connectivity:** On the home front, the US is investing heavily (like through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill) to provide high-speed internet to all Americans, especially those in rural, agricultural, tribal areas, and low-income households. While not directly about *subsea* cables, this reflects the broader commitment to robust digital infrastructure.
6.  **Building Partnerships:** The US recognizes it can't achieve these goals alone. It's actively building a network of partnerships with allies through initiatives like the Quad alliance, the G7's Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, and NATO, to coordinate efforts and offer alternatives to investments from rival nations.

In essence, the US wants to keep the internet's underwater backbone strong, secure, and free from the control or influence of adversaries, ensuring open access and fair competition globally."

Oxygen is a drug with a correct dosage
When administered correctly may be life saving.
Aim is to achieve adequate tissue oxygenation
(without causing a significant decrease in ventilation and
consequent hypercapnia or oxygen toxicity)
Need to treat
•	 Tissue hypoxia is difficult to recognize as clinical features
are nonspecific –include dyspnoea cyanosis, tachypnoea,
arrhythmias, altered mental state, coma.
•	 Treatment of tissue hypoxia should correct any arterial
hypoxemia (Cardiopulmonary defect/shunt e.g.-asthma,
pneumonia, PE), any transport deficit (anaemia, low
cardiac output), and underlying causes.
•	 SaO2/PaO2 can be normal when tissue hypoxia is
caused by low cardiac output states.
Oxygen administration Equipment
The method of delivery will depend on the type and severity
of respiratory failure, breathing pattern, respiratory rate,
risk of CO2 retention, need for humidification and patient
compliance.
Each oxygen delivery device comprises
•	 An oxygen supply(>4L/min)
•	 Flow rate
07.Oxygen administration

•	 Can be used for long periods of time.
•	 Prevent rebreathing.
•	 Can be used during eating and talking.
2) Low flow oxygen masks
These deliver oxygen concentrations that vary depending
on the patient’s minute volume. Some rebreathing of
exhaled gases.

3) Fixed performance masks
These deliver constant concentration of oxygen independent
of the patient’s minute volume.
The masks contain ‘venturi’ barrels where relatively low
rates of oxygen are forced through a narrow orifice producing
a greater flow rate.
4) Partial and non-rebreathe masks
This mask have a ‘reservoir’ bag that is filled with pure
oxygen and depend on a system of valves which prevent
mixing of exhaled gases with the incoming oxygen.

What benefits do nasal cannula have over non-rebreathe masks?","Nasal cannulas can be used for long periods of time, prevent rebreathing, and can be used during eating and talking (Dr.M.Umakanth, Hand book of Basic Medical Procedure, p. 20). Non-rebreathe masks have a reservoir bag filled with pure oxygen and a system of valves to prevent mixing of exhaled gases with incoming oxygen (Dr.M.Umakanth, Hand book of Basic Medical Procedure, p. 21).","Based on the document provided, nasal cannulas offer several distinct benefits over non-rebreathe masks, primarily related to patient comfort and convenience:

1.  **Extended Use:** Nasal cannulas ""Can be used for long periods of time,"" which suggests they are more comfortable and less intrusive for patients requiring ongoing oxygen therapy. Masks can often feel confining over long durations.
2.  **Eating and Talking:** A significant advantage of nasal cannulas is that they ""Can be used during eating and talking."" This allows patients to maintain normal activities like eating meals and communicating without interruption to their oxygen supply, which masks would typically impede.

While both devices aim to prevent rebreathing of exhaled gases (the document states nasal cannulas ""Prevent rebreathing"" and non-rebreathe masks have a system of valves to prevent mixing of exhaled gases with incoming oxygen), the key practical benefits of nasal cannulas lie in their less restrictive nature, promoting better patient comfort and allowing for more normal daily activities."

It affects close to 10 million people per year[1].Despite the diagnosis of TB often being a diagnostic dilemma in kidney disease patients, kidney transplant candidates (KTC) and kidney transplant recipients (KTR) have a 3.62- and 11.35 times higher risk of developing TB, respectively, compared to the general population[2]. They also have a higher rate of mortality due to TB. Treatment of TB also poses unique challenges  in  these patients due to renal dose  modifications,  drug interactions, and nephrotoxicity of anti-tubercular agents.EPIDEMIOLOGYIncidence of TB in dialysis patients and transplant candidatesThe incidence of TB in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) ranges between 60-19, 270 per 100000 population in various countries (highest incidence in the African region and lowest in the Americas), the pooled incidence being 3718 per 100000[3]. In  general, extrapulmonary TB is  more common than pulmonary  TB in this population[2,3]. Amongst patients with CKD, those on dialysis, who are conventionally considered transplant candidates, are at a higher risk of developing TB as compared to earlier stages of CKD. Patients on hemodialysis have a higher incidence than those on peritoneal dialysis (5611/100000 vs 3533/100000 respectively)[3].Incidence of TB in KTRTB incidence is said to be 7-27 times higher than the general population in solid organ transplant recipients[4]. KTR have a 4.59 times higher risk of developing TB compared to the general population[5]. The incidence of TB in KTR was 2700/100000 population in a pooled systemic analysis[3] from across the world with a range of 340-14680/100000[6,7].NATURAL HISTORY OF TB IN TRANSPLANT CANDIDATES AND RECIPIENTSMycobacterium tuberculosis acquisitionThe primary transmission route of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) is through aerosols, with the lungs being the primary  site  of  host-pathogen  interaction.  The  innate  immune  system  tends  to  clear  the M. tuberculosis bacilli immediately through phagocytosis. However, there is a possibility of the following four distinct outcomes because of complex host-pathogen  interplay[8]:  (1)  Immediate  clearance  of bacilli; (2) Chronic or latent infection; (3)  Rapidly progressive TB; or (4) Reactivation after a prolonged period.Granuloma formationIf the  bacilli are not removed immediately, granulomas  are formed, where inflammatory cells and  cytokines come together and generate a localized response, known as the ""Ghon's complex"". It includes organ parenchymal involvement along with  regional adenopathy. Effective cell-mediated  immunity usually develops in  4-6 weeks and halts  further infection progression[8].Progression and disseminationWhen the host cannot produce a sufficient cell-mediated immune response, the infection spreads and destroys the tissue. Arterial erosion  promotes hematogenous spread, which  results in disseminated TB that  eventually affects multiple organs.Reactivation and immunosuppressed statesIn immunocompromised states, there may be a reactivation of M. tuberculosis CKD, specifically kidney failure, is one such condition where reactivation of previous infection is the most common cause of TB. Earlier, this reactivation was typically limited to a single organ, the most common site being the upper lobe of the lung[8]. However, now extrapulmonary TB is seen to be more common in these patients. Extrapulmonary involvement can affect various other organs and appear with a myriad of clinical symptoms. Almost every organ being involved has been described, including the musculoskeletal system, gastrointestinal tract, liver, skin, orbit, genitourinary tract,  lymph nodes, pericardium,  larynx, kidneys, and adrenal glands[8,9].
Prasad P et al. TB in kidney transplantationWJT https://www.wjgnet.com 3September 18, 2024 Volume 14 Issue 3Natural history in transplant recipientsBecause of  the  immunosuppression,  the  natural  history of TB infection is more complex in transplant patients.  In developing countries, reactivation from previously acquired infections is more common than re-infection[8,9]. With a median time of onset of 9 months, most active TB cases are recognized during the first year post-transplantation[10-13]. Also, although pulmonary TB is the most common presentation in KTR, they are more likely to develop extrapulmonary TB compared to the general population[12,14,15].MODES OF TRANSMISSIONFor primary prevention, early diagnosis, and prompt treatment, understanding the various modes of transmission of TB is crucial. The various modes of transmission among transplant candidates and recipients are illustrated in Figure 1 and enlisted below[16,17]: (1) Airborne transmission: Aerosol transmission remains the predominant mechanism, particularly in enclosed and congested environments; (2) Reactivation from latent infection: In areas where TB is highly prevalent, reactivation of  latent  TB  is a frequent mechanism of transmission;  (3)  Nosocomial  transmission: The possibility of nosocomial transmission is a worry  in healthcare environments.  Strict infection control procedures are necessary in transplant units, where immunocompromised patients are concentrated, to stop TB from spreading among recipients; (4) Donor-derived transmission:  Rarely, transmission can occur directly  from the donor organ. Thorough  screening  of potential organ donors is essential to avoid unintentionally spreading TB during transplant procedures; and (5) Unusual routes of transmission: Environmental sources have been reported to host viable and infectious TB for long periods. These sources include soil, rivers, wastewater, fomites, dust, and even cadavers. There have been reports of TB transmission through topical wound site contamination, aerosolization during surgery, and intake of water tainted with sanatorium effluent. Also, the incidence of pediatric cases due to intestinal TB is showing an increasing trend, probably due to the ingestion of contaminated milk or sputum[16].Factors influencing transmissionThe probability that an individual with TB will transmit M. tuberculosis to others is determined by many factors, including the number and rate of infectious droplet production and virulence of the disease of the original host who transmits the infection[18]. Environmental factors include duration and extent of contact. Better air circulation and increased ultraviolet (UV) light  exposure  in  the  space of contact decrease the chances of transmission. Host  factors  include  the  type of induction and maintenance immunosuppression among transplant patients[18].

Question: What is the Ghon's complex?","If bacilli are not immediately removed, granulomas are formed, where inflammatory cells and cytokines come together and generate a localized response known as the ""Ghon's complex"" [8]. It includes organ parenchymal involvement along with regional adenopathy [8].","The Ghon's complex is a specific localized immune response that forms in the body when *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* bacilli (the bacteria that causes TB) are not immediately cleared by the immune system.

Here's a breakdown of what it is:

*   **Formation:** If the *M. tuberculosis* bacilli are not removed right away, the body's immune system kicks into action. Inflammatory cells and signaling proteins (cytokines) gather together to create a localized response.
*   **Components:** This response, known as the Ghon's complex, includes two main parts:
    1.  **Organ Parenchymal Involvement:** This refers to the primary site of infection in the organ itself, typically the lungs, where the bacilli initially landed.
    2.  **Regional Adenopathy:** This means the involvement of nearby lymph nodes that drain the area of the primary infection.
*   **Immune Response:** Typically, if a person has an effective cell-mediated immune response, this Ghon's complex helps to halt the progression of the infection within about 4-6 weeks. It essentially walls off the infection, preventing it from spreading further, often leading to a latent (inactive) infection.

In essence, the Ghon's complex is a key pathological hallmark of primary tuberculosis infection, indicating where the initial fight between the host's immune system and the *M. tuberculosis* bacteria took place."

First Timer’s Guide:
Credit Cards
Used the right way, your credit card
can be your new financial BFF.
HonestMoney.ca
Like most things, with great power comes great responsibility. And credit cards are
no different. Used the right way, they can be your new financial BFF. But before you
tap, swipe, and charge your way into a bold new financial future, it’s important to
have a handle on the basics to avoid some of the downsides of living that plastic life.
First things first: What is a credit card?
In the most basic sense, a credit card is a piece of plastic that allows you to pay for
things with borrowed money. It’s an agreement between you and a financial institution
where you can opt to pay on credit rather than with actual money. In practice, it’s a
little more involved than that. Your credit card comes with a limit—that is the amount
of money you have to borrow against. And those charges? You’re going to pay interest
on them if you carry a balance. But we’re getting ahead of ourselves.
Before you get swiping, make sure you know why. And how, so you can do it
responsibly.
Why you should have a credit card?
There are lots of reasons why having a credit card can make you into a financial super
hero:
TO BUILD CREDIT
Somewhere down the line, you will need a credit history. And a credit
card—when used correctly—is one of the easiest way to build credit. When
the time comes to take out a car loan or get a mortgage, your financial
institution will refer back to your credit history to see how reliable you are
with borrowing money. So even if a credit card seems unnecessary, making
frequent purchases with it and immediately paying it off will help you build
a positive credit history, which will pay off in the future.
FLIGHTS, RENTALS, HOTELS, AND ONLINE SHOPPING
If you want to get on planes, trains, or automobiles, or to purchase the
latest bobble from your favourite online retailer, you’re going to need a
credit card. Ditto for booking a room in a hotel, booking concert tickets,
and more.
HonestMoney.ca
REWARDS
A lot of cards actually reward you for using them with things like cash back,
travel points, or exclusive offers like concert tickets. As long as you’re
managing your balance wisely, using your credit card frequently can help
you treat yourself later.
EMERGENCIES
Hopefully it never happens, but every once and while we all get stuck
in emergencies where we just don’t have cash on hand. And although
you should never put something on your credit card if you don’t have the
money to pay for it, your card might help you get out of a tough situation in
the very short term – or at least until you can take stock of your situation
and sit down with your financial expert to come up with a longer term plan.
How to choose a card that’s right for you
Now that you’ve decided to get a credit card, you have to ask yourself—which one
should I apply for?
Types of credit cards
No or Low Annual Fee Cards: These cards offer the convenience of having a credit
card in your wallet without a high annual fee. Most low or no annual fee cards offer
basic rewards but may not accumulate perks as quickly as a fee-based card.
Low Interest Rate Cards: Many cards have interest rates upwards of 19.5%, but
there are cards available with lower interest rates in exchange for a low annual fee.
These cards often don’t accumulate rewards quickly, but if you find yourself carrying a
balance on your card month over month, this can be a smart choice.
Cash Back Cards: Not all card rewards come in the form of points. For every
purchase you make, cash back cards offer a percentage back in cash credited to your
statement at a set time.
Rewards Cards: For every purchase you make on your card, you’ll accumulate a set
number of rewards points. Points can be redeemed for all sorts of different things,
ranging from the latest gadgets and gift cards, to concert tickets and experiences.
HonestMoney.ca
Student Cards: You guessed it! These cards are specifically meant for students who
are just starting to build their credit. These often come with low or no fees and offer
basic rewards.
Travel Rewards Cards: Similar to a rewards card, but focused on travel. Travel rewards
cards feature points that can be redeemed for flights, hotels, and car rentals and
often include insurance coverage for things like out-of-country medical, lost luggage,
or changes to travel plans.
US Dollar Cards: These cards allow you to make purchases directly in US dollars.
It’s a good idea to be honest with yourself about how you plan to use your card and
what’s really important to you. For instance, if you’re keeping your card in case of
emergencies only, a low or no annual fee card might make the most sense. If you find
yourself traveling often, the protections and perks that come with a travel rewards
card might provide you with the best value.
Once you have a better sense of your needs and habits, take the time to go online and
do a little bit of research. Check out and compare different cards. Look at the features
and benefits and what you need to apply. Some cards have a minimum income
threshold to qualify or are designed specifically for students, so make sure you know
what you’re getting yourself into.
HonestMoney.ca
Applying for your card
Just because you want a credit card, doesn’t mean you can always get a credit card.
Like any kind of credit, there is an application process to complete before you can
start spending.
1. Go online (financial institution) or in branch.
2. Fill out an application; pay stubs, Social Insurance Number, ID, employment &
income verification; other important info.
3. (If approved) activate your card!
How to manage your card
So, you have your credit card. Now what? While using your card is pretty straight
forward, there are a couple of important things to know about managing your card.
First, not every purchase on a credit card is created equal. While most of us tend to
think of credit card purchases as tapping or swiping your card in a store or inputting
your information online, you can also use your credit card to get cash or to make
cash-like transactions. This is called a cash advance.
Taking a cash advance might sound like a good idea, but this can be a costly way to
access cash in the long run. Cash advances often charge a small fee to initiate and
almost always charge a higher rate of interest than regular purchases. The other
thing to keep in mind is how interest accumulates. With regular purchases, you have
a grace period (usually 21 days or more) before interest begins to accumulate on the
money you owe. When you take a cash advance, interest starts to accumulate right
away and will continue to accrue until the whole amount of the advance is paid off
in full.
Don’t apply for every offer: Each time you apply for a credit
card there will be an inquiry made on your credit history. Lots of
inquiries over a short period of time can impact your credit score
and lots of open, available cards can hurt your chances to qualify
for more credit in the future.
HonestMoney.ca
You can also expect to get a monthly statement whether you use your card or not.
Statements provide a detailed snapshot for a set period of time and outline your
purchases, how much you owe, the minimum payment due, and when you need to
make a payment. Statements are monthly, but may not run from the first day of the
month to the last.
When you get your statement, be sure to review it carefully. If something doesn’t make
sense on your statement, or if there is something you don’t recognize, don’t be afraid
to speak up and ask your card provider for more details.
Credit card Dos and Don’ts
DO DON’T
• Pay off your full balance each month, if
possible
• Buy things you can easily pay for
• Stay at around 50% of your credit limit
• Check your balance on a regular basis
• Become familiar with your grace periods
and when interest kicks in
• Make your payments on time
• Take advantage of rewards programs
• Just make the minimum payment
required each month
• Pay for things you can’t afford
• Regularly run your balance close to your
limit
• Ignore your balance and transactions
• Pay late or forget to make your payments
altogether
• Don’t make purchases just to gain
rewards
Be aware of your terms and conditions: If an offer seems too good
to be true, it probably is. And the same goes for credit cards. Be
cautious when it comes to 0% offers in exchange for making a big
purchase and be sure that you understand the terms and conditions
before signing up. Zero interest doesn’t last forever and some credit cards can
charge very high interest rates once their introductory offers have expired.
HonestMoney.ca
Interest
Every credit card has an interest rate. When you make a purchase with your credit
card, your grace period for that transaction starts. This means that you have around
21-25 days (each credit card provider is different) to pay off that transaction before
interest charges kick in. If you keep an unpaid balance on your credit card, interest
will keep adding up month by month. But if you pay off the full balance on time,
you’ll never have to pay interest! And remember, only making the minimum payment
required each month still means you get charged interest on the full balance.

Keeping your credit card info safe
Credit cards have a lot of great security features, but knowing how to protect your card
information is probably the biggest thing you can do to keep yourself from fraud. Here
are a few easy tips that can help.
Be aware of email phishing or fraudulent phone calls: Scammers will often try to
create a sense of panic, trying to persuade you to give out your information.
Don’t do it!
Never give you credit card info over the phone or in an email: Your credit card
provider or financial institution will never call you and ask for your credit card info over
the phone/email.
Cancel your card immediately if you ever lose it: Fraudulent transactions can be
refunded if you report the card missing before they happen.
Don’t write down your credit card information to store it: Enough said!
Review your transactions regularly and ask lots of questions: Regularly check your
transactions and balance and don’t be afraid to ask your card provider questions if
you don’t recognize something.

Glossary
APR
This is short for Annual Percentage Rate. APR is the rate charged to the amount
borrowed on your credit card, expressed as a percentage. (See Interest Rate
definition.)
ANNUAL FEE
A yearly fee that is charged for having certain credit cards in your wallet. Not all credit
cards have annual fees. The fee can range in price and typically includes access to
other perks, points, or benefits above and beyond what you get with a standard, nofee card.
BALANCE
This is how much money you owe on your credit card.
CREDIT LIMIT
The maximum dollar amount you can spend on your credit card.
GRACE PERIOD
Typically, when you make a purchase on your credit card, interest doesn’t begin to
accumulate immediately. Instead, you get a grace period (usually a minimum of
21 days) to make payments before you are charged interest. If you pay off the full
amount owing on your card before the end of your grace period, you will not be
charged interest.
INTEREST RATE
This is the percentage of interest that is charged on any balance owing on your card
after the grace period is up. Interest is calculated daily and charged to your card
monthly. Interest rates can vary from card to card.
MINIMUM PAYMENT
This is the smallest dollar amount that you can pay each month to keep your credit
card account in good standing.
STATEMENT
Your credit card statement is a detailed list showing all of your transactions during
your billing cycle, along with your balance owing (as of your statement date), your
minimum payment, and when your payment is due.

What are the consequences of using your credit card to get cash instead of just making regular purchases?","Using a credit card to get cash, known as a cash advance, has several consequences compared to making regular purchases:
*   It can be a costly way to access cash in the long run [HonestMoney.ca].
*   Cash advances often charge a small fee to initiate [HonestMoney.ca].
*   They almost always charge a higher rate of interest than regular purchases [HonestMoney.ca].
*   Interest starts to accumulate right away with a cash advance and continues until the full amount is paid off [HonestMoney.ca]. In contrast, regular purchases typically have a grace period (usually 21 days or more) before interest begins to accumulate [HonestMoney.ca].","Using your credit card to get cash, often called a **cash advance**, comes with several important consequences that differ significantly from regular purchases. It's generally a more expensive way to access money due to specific fees and interest structures.

Here's a breakdown of the consequences:

1.  **Higher Interest Rates:** Cash advances almost always have a higher interest rate compared to your standard purchase interest rate. This means the money you borrow as cash will cost you more in interest.
2.  **Immediate Interest Accumulation (No Grace Period):** Unlike regular purchases, where you typically have a grace period (often 21 days or more) before interest starts to accrue, interest on a cash advance begins immediately from the moment you take it out. There's no window to pay it off interest-free.
3.  **Additional Fees:** You'll usually be charged a small fee just to initiate the cash advance. This is an extra cost on top of the interest.
4.  **Interest Accrues Until Paid in Full:** The higher interest rate will continue to build up daily until you pay off the entire cash advance amount.

In essence, while a credit card can be a financial ""BFF"" when used for purchases and paid off on time, a cash advance is a much costlier option that should generally be avoided unless it's a true emergency and you understand the immediate and higher financial implications."

When you’re trying to score a break at tax time, maxing out your deductions can potentially lower your bill or result in a bigger tax return. Apart from the standard write-offs for things like mortgage interest or business travel, you may be able to claim more unusual expenses, including the cost of taking care of a pet. The IRS has certain rules about when pet expenses are tax-deductible, so if you’ve got some furry friends at home, here are a few scenarios where you might benefit.
 

 Consider working with a financial advisor as you work on a budget, whether that includes a pet or not.
 

 

 

 You Require a Pet for Medical Reasons
 Service animals can take many different forms, including dogs, cats and even miniature ponies. If you’re required to have a guide, service or therapy animal because you have a diagnosed medical condition, such as blindness, epilepsy or post-traumatic stress disorder, you may be able to deduct the cost of its care as a medical expense on your taxes.
 

 In order to meet the IRS standards your pet must be certified and trained as a service animal. The types of costs you can deduct include grooming, food, veterinary care and training. You might also be able to claim vet bills on taxes for pets you foster, provided that the nonprofit organization hasn’t reimbursed you and the organization is registered with the IRS.

 You Use a Guard Dog for Your Business
 While you can’t technically put a dog on the payroll, you may still be able to deduct the cost of its care as a business expense if it’s used primarily to guard your premises and inventory. The IRS doesn’t allow you to write off the cost of buying the dog itself, but you can use the deduction for things like food, training, boarding and medical care. Keep in mind that it only applies to the dog’s working hours, not expenses incurred during the animal’s down time.
 

 

 You Foster Pets in Your Home
 Volunteering with a service animal agency or pet rescue organization is a great way to give back, and it can also pay off at tax time. If you foster pets, either in your home or on your property, you may be eligible to claim the deduction for unreimbursed expenses. That covers food, shelter, veterinary bills, grooming costs, litter and bedding materials. These expenses would qualify as charitable donations, which are deductible up to 50 percent of your adjusted gross income.
 

 You’re a Professional Breeder
 SmartAsset: When Are Pet Expenses Tax-Deductible?
 If breeding and selling dogs, cats or other animals is your primary occupation, there’s good news: not only can you deduct food, medical bills and boarding costs, but you can also write off any other ordinary and necessary expenses that running your business entails. This includes things like advertising, costs relating to the business use of your home, and travel expenses. If you breed animals as a hobby, you only qualify for the deduction if your expenses exceed 2 percent of your adjusted gross income and you itemize.
 

 You’re a Law Enforcement Dog Handler
 Some of the cost that goes along with maintaining a police dog may also qualify for a tax deduction if you’re not reimbursed for these expenses through your job. If the dog lives in your home when not on-duty and you’re responsible for buying its food or purchasing a kennel, you can generally claim them as a job-related expense.
 

 The Main Rule for Cutting Your Tax Bill
 The No. 1 rule when it comes to claiming deductions for pet care is to make sure you’re documenting your expenses carefully. If you include something that you know is deductible but you don’t have documentation to support it, you may run into trouble if you’re audited. You don’t want to end up in the doghouse with Uncle Sam, so hanging on to all of your receipts is a must.
 

 Bottom Line
 SmartAsset: When Are Pet Expenses Tax-Deductible?
 Contrary to what many people may think, it is very possible to claim deductions for your pet-related expenses. Just be sure to keep careful and complete records of what you spend and why you spent it. Was it for a work-related matter? Or was it for non-compensated activity like fostering pets? Keep in mind that moving expenses are no longer deductible.
 

 Tips on Taxes
 A financial advisor can offer valuable insight and guidance as you explore ways to reduce your taxes, including by deducting pet-related expenses. Finding a financial advisor doesn’t have to be hard. SmartAsset’s free tool matches you with up to three financial advisors who serve your area, and you can interview your advisor matches at no cost to decide which one is right for you.

I just adopted a German Shepard puppy through a local pet rescue. I also own a small business with inventory in an outbuilding on my property. Can I deduct the adoption fee and all of the expenses for this dog if I am using him a few hours a day as a guard dog?","No, you cannot deduct the adoption fee for the German Shepherd puppy (When Are Pet Expenses Tax-Deductible?).

You may be able to deduct some expenses for the dog if it is used primarily to guard your business premises and inventory (When Are Pet Expenses Tax-Deductible?). However, the deduction only applies to the dog's working hours, not expenses incurred during its downtime, and the IRS does not allow you to write off the cost of buying the dog itself (When Are Pet Expenses Tax-Deductible?). Deductible costs for a guard dog can include food, training, boarding, and medical care (When Are Pet Expenses Tax-Deductible?).","That's wonderful that you've adopted a German Shepherd puppy! They can be amazing companions. Let's break down your question about deducting the costs for your new furry friend, especially with your small business in mind.

Based on the IRS rules outlined in the document, here's how your situation might play out:

1.  **The Adoption Fee for the Dog Itself:**
    Unfortunately, the IRS generally **does not allow you to deduct the cost of acquiring the animal itself**, whether it's an adoption fee or a purchase price. The document specifically states, ""The IRS doesn’t allow you to write off the cost of buying the dog itself."" So, while the adoption fee is a necessary part of bringing your puppy home, it wouldn't be a deductible business expense.

2.  **Ongoing Expenses for a Guard Dog:**
    This is where it gets a bit more nuanced. The good news is that if you use your German Shepherd **primarily to guard your business premises and inventory**, you **may be able to deduct the costs of its care as a business expense**. This includes things like food, training, veterinary care, and even boarding if applicable.

    However, there are a couple of crucial points to consider:
    *   **""Primarily to guard your premises"":** The document emphasizes that the dog must be used *primarily* for guarding. If your puppy is mainly a family pet that also spends a few hours a day near your outbuilding, it might be challenging to meet this ""primarily"" standard. The IRS would look for evidence that its main purpose is business security, not just companionship.
    *   **""Working hours"" vs. ""down time"":** The deduction ""only applies to the dog’s working hours, not expenses incurred during the animal’s down time."" This means you might need to prorate expenses. For example, if the dog truly only guards for a few hours a day and is a pet the rest of the time, you couldn't deduct 100% of its food or vet bills. This can be quite difficult to track and justify.

**In summary for your situation:**

*   **Adoption fee:** Likely **not deductible**.
*   **Ongoing expenses (food, vet, training):** Potentially **deductible as a business expense**, but only if the dog is **primarily** used for guarding your business and you can clearly differentiate expenses related to its ""working hours"" from its ""down time"" as a pet. Given you mentioned ""a few hours a day,"" and it's a new puppy that will likely have a strong pet role, proving it's *primarily* a guard dog and accurately prorating costs could be complex.

**Important Additional Advice:**

*   **Documentation is key:** As the document stresses, ""The No. 1 rule when it comes to claiming deductions for pet care is to make sure you’re documenting your expenses carefully."" Keep meticulous records of all costs and details of how your dog is used for business security.
*   **Consider a financial advisor:** Tax rules, especially for unusual deductions, can be complex. Working with a financial advisor or a tax professional can provide personalized guidance for your specific business and help ensure you're compliant with IRS regulations. They can help you understand if your particular situation meets the ""primarily"" and ""working hours"" criteria and how best to document everything.

While it's exciting to think about potential tax breaks, it's essential to ensure you meet the IRS's strict requirements to avoid any issues down the line. Congratulations on your new puppy!"

Internal environment of Nintendo
(1) Analysis of Nintendo's advantages
Competitive advantage refers to an enterprise's ability to outperform its competitors, which helps
to achieve its main goal -- profit. Nintendo's strengths lie in the following ways [3]. Nintendo has
developed a unique profit distribution system based on its nearly 50 years of experience in the game
industry. At that time, the manager in charge of Nintendo drew lessons from the ""collapse of Atari"".
First, he set up a ""Mario Club"" game quality supervision agency to strictly screen the game software
on the Nintendo game console. Later, he set up a ""royalty system"" and formulated a set of rules for
game review, platform access, and game revenue sharing, which brought huge profits to Nintendo,
At the same time, it objectively promoted the benign development of the Japanese game industry at
that time. These systems are also the internal reason why the overall quality of Nintendo Switch
games is much better than its competitors. Super big IPs such as Super Mario and Legend of Zelda
have always maintained a good reputation and remain popular among players. It is these unique
systems that enable Nintendo to maintain a high-profit margin even in the context of economic
depression [4].
(2) Analysis of Nintendo's disadvantages
First, Nintendo's failed family business management style. The presidents of Nintendo's Japanese
and American divisions (NOA) often have differences due to huge differences in management
methods, and the consequences of such differences are devastating because they will lead to key
employees becoming vulnerable and even leaving to do other work. Therefore, the family business
management model seriously leads to the failure of efficient cooperation between Nintendo's various
branches, and will also seriously harm Nintendo's external reputation and damage Nintendo's overall
interests [5].
Secondly, weak technology research and development capability. With the growing demand for
personalized service, companies are required to provide increasingly specialized service strategies
and differentiated solutions, for example, more and more game companies begin to focus on creating
products with local characteristics based on the language and cultural background of different regions,
which is also the basis for a game to be promoted around the world. In addition, the development of
modern games also needs the support of technological innovation. For example, more and more VR,
AR, and motion capture games are emerging in the market. It would be unthinkable for Nintendo to
spend huge resources on a new generation of high-performance consoles to compete with SONY.
Conversely, it is in the area of research and development that Nintendo's other rival, Microsoft, has
the greatest advantage.
3.3.2 External environment of Nintendo
(1) Opportunity for Nintendo
In terms of technology and business environment, Nintendo has much more experience than its
competitors with the background of years of exploration in the gaming industry. Even though
Microsoft recently acquired the game giant Blizzard, it intends to expand its market share in the game
industry. However, Microsoft did not intervene in Blizzard's daily operation, which was also due to
its limited experience in the game industry. These factors can also reduce Nintendo's competitive
pressure [6].
In terms of the political and legal environment, the government's favorable policies also help game
companies expand their overseas markets. Also, under the catalysis of the epidemic economy, video
games have become one of the most popular cultural and creative activities for young people in the
world. Many governments are aware of this trend and have introduced a series of supportive policies,
such as setting up special funds for the game industry; Promise the game developer that adding
landmark landmarks in the game can get financial support and tax concessions. These policies are
good news for multinational game companies like Nintendo to expand their overseas markets.
(2) Threat for Nintendo
Highlights in Business, Economics and Management FMIBM 2023
Volume 10 (2023)

Microsoft's strong economic strength enables them to continue to operate in the gaming industry
after experiencing the cost of failure in the game product competition of 4 billion dollars and make
up for the shortcomings of their predecessors in new products. At the same time, Microsoft could use
money offensive to buy third-party platform certification. Finally, and most importantly, Microsoft's
latest games are coming out one year earlier than Nintendo's or SONY's, making it harder for
Nintendo to time and win the market.
4. Nintendo’s market strategy suggestion
As the gaming industry continues to evolve, scholars generally agree that gaming companies need
not only excellent hardware and software technology but also effective marketing strategies. Schilling
MA (2003) believes that if companies in the game industry want to maintain their market share, they
need to improve their marketing strategies to follow or even guide the market trend [7]. Marchand A
and Hennig-Thurau T (2013) think that companies in the game industry need to pay attention to
consumers' preferences in the market, understand consumers' needs in the form of questionnaires, etc.,
to design their products in a targeted way [8]. SC Jain (1989) thinks that companies in the game
industry need to pay attention to consumers' preferences in the market, understand consumers' needs
in the form of questionnaires, etc., to design their products in a targeted way [9]. Based on the above
analysis of Nintendo's internal and external conditions, this report proposes the following
improvement suggestions [10].
Nintendo could consider setting up more offline experience stores overseas. Nintendo's classic
game characters, such as Mario, Pokemon, Kirby, and Link, are familiar to the public. Taking these
characters as ambassadors of offline experience stores, they can attract enough attention without too
much publicity expenses and are very attractive to children and adults.
Nintendo could consider adding episode-by-episode, level-by-level incrementally unlocked
purchases. Because Nintendo's software games are priced in a complementary way to the console's
price, they are generally priced higher than other games in the market. This can lead to players who
want to play a game but don't buy it because the price is too high. In this case, the buy-out system can
be supplemented with the option of gradually unlocking purchases by episode or level, and players
can choose to buy them out or buy them separately. That way, players can play more games, and
buying incrementally doesn't feel like a buy-out. This is also a great way for Nintendo to increase its
sales.
Nintendo could increase its ban on cracking consoles and develop new encryption technologies.
For now, Nintendo's crackdown on cracked consoles is not strong enough, and only users who use
cracked consoles to connect to the Internet have been blocked. In this case, to protect their intellectual
property rights, but also promote the sale of their legitimate games, the development of a new set of
encryption technology is worth considering.

What advantages does Nintendo have over its competitors?","Nintendo has several advantages over its competitors:
*   It has developed a unique profit distribution system based on nearly 50 years of experience in the game industry, which includes a ""Mario Club"" game quality supervision agency and a ""royalty system"" with rules for game review, platform access, and game revenue sharing [3]. These systems enable Nintendo to maintain a high-profit margin even in economic depression and are the internal reason why the overall quality of Nintendo Switch games is better than competitors' [4].
*   Super big IPs like Super Mario and Legend of Zelda have maintained a good reputation and remain popular among players [4].
*   In terms of technology and business environment, Nintendo has much more experience than its competitors due to years of exploration in the gaming industry [6]. For example, even though Microsoft acquired Blizzard, it did not intervene in Blizzard's daily operation, partly due to its limited experience in the game industry, which reduces Nintendo's competitive pressure [6].","Nintendo has several significant advantages that set it apart from its competitors, primarily stemming from its extensive history and unique business practices in the gaming industry:

1.  **Unique and Profitable Business Model:** Nintendo has developed a sophisticated profit distribution system based on nearly 50 years of experience. This system was designed to avoid pitfalls observed in the past (like the ""collapse of Atari"") and includes:
    *   **Strict Quality Control:** A ""Mario Club"" game quality supervision agency ensures that games released on Nintendo platforms meet high standards. This is a key reason why Nintendo Switch games often have better overall quality compared to competitors.
    *   **Royalty System:** A well-defined royalty system governs game review, platform access, and revenue sharing. This structure has not only generated substantial profits for Nintendo but also fostered healthy development within the Japanese game industry.
    *   **High-Profit Margins:** These unique systems allow Nintendo to maintain impressive profit margins, even during challenging economic times.

2.  **Powerful and Beloved Intellectual Properties (IPs):** Nintendo boasts an unparalleled catalog of iconic characters and franchises, such as Super Mario, The Legend of Zelda, Pokémon, Kirby, and Link. These ""super big IPs"" consistently maintain excellent reputations and remain incredibly popular across generations of players, providing a continuous draw for their consoles and games.

3.  **Extensive Industry Experience:** With decades of exploration and innovation in the gaming sector, Nintendo possesses a depth of experience that often surpasses newer or less focused competitors. For example, while Microsoft has acquired gaming giants like Blizzard, its relatively limited direct experience in the gaming industry means it often avoids intervening in the daily operations of its acquisitions, which can reduce direct competitive pressure on Nintendo.

These strengths, particularly its proven business model and beloved franchises, allow Nintendo to stand out and thrive in the highly competitive video game market."

**Mismatch repair deficiency doesn’t always boost immunotherapy response**

Mismatch repair deficiency occurs when tumor cells have a mutation in one of several genes that normally correct mistakes in the DNA code. Without that DNA spellchecker, the tumor constantly accumulates genetic mutations, leading to a high tumor mutational burden. To investigate why some tumors with deficient mismatch repair don’t respond to immune checkpoint inhibitors, Dr. Westcott and his colleagues genetically engineered mice to spontaneously grow lung or colorectal tumors that were either deficient in mismatch repair or had functioning mismatch repair.  Tumors that were deficient in mismatch repair had many more mutations than tumors with functioning mismatch repair, the researchers confirmed.  When they treated both sets of mice with an immune checkpoint inhibitor, they found an unexpected result: mismatch repair–deficient tumors didn’t shrink any more than tumors with functioning mismatch repair. In further experiments, the team figured out why. It came down to both the diversity and the type of mutations in the tumors, Dr. Westcott explained.
The mismatch repair–deficient tumors had a lot of genetic diversity, meaning each mutation was only in a small fraction of cancer cells. And cancer-killing immune cells couldn't efficiently attack tumors with high genetic diversity, the researchers found. But when they created tumors in which all of the cancer cells had the same mutations, immune checkpoint inhibitors shrank the tumors and kept them at bay for months. The type of mutation also appeared to influence how immune system responds to tumors. Some mutations cause tumor cells to produce abnormal bits of proteins on their surface, called neoantigens. Neoantigens help the immune system spot cancer cells, whereas other types of mutations are less likely to jump-start the immune system.  Cancer-killing immune cells launched a massive attack against tumors in which all of the cancer cells had the same neoantigen, called clonal neoantigens. But that attack weakened when only a fraction of the cancer cells had the neoantigen, the researchers found.

USER REQUEST:
In the context of the described medical study in the provided text, what task (or tasks) do ""Neoantigens"" have?",Neoantigens help the immune system spot cancer cells (Neoantigens help the immune system spot cancer cells).,"That's a great question, and the study sheds some light on the crucial role of neoantigens in the fight against cancer!

Based on the described medical study, neoantigens have a very specific and important task:

1.  **Help the immune system spot cancer cells:** Neoantigens are abnormal bits of proteins produced by tumor cells due to certain mutations. They essentially act like a ""flag"" on the surface of cancer cells, making them recognizable to the immune system.
2.  **Jump-start the immune system:** By being recognized, neoantigens help to initiate or ""jump-start"" an immune response against the tumor cells. In simpler terms, they signal to cancer-killing immune cells that these cells are foreign and need to be attacked.

The study further emphasizes the importance of how these neoantigens are presented. When all cancer cells in a tumor have the *same* neoantigen (referred to as ""clonal neoantigens""), it leads to a much stronger and more effective attack by the immune system, often shrinking the tumors. However, if only a fraction of the cancer cells display these neoantigens, the immune attack is significantly weakened, making it harder for the immune system to effectively clear the tumor."

Intermittent fasting is an eating pattern that may benefit heart health, reduce inflammation, improve cell repair processes, and help burn fat
 Intermittent fasting is an eating pattern in which you cycle between periods of eating and periods of fasting.
 There are many types of intermittent fasting, such as the 16:8 and 5:2 methods.
 Numerous studies suggest that it can have powerful benefits for your body and brain.
 Here are 10 evidence-based health benefits of intermittent fasting.
 1. Changes in the function of hormones, cells, and genes
 When you don’t eat for a while, several things happen in your body.
 For example, your body changes hormone levels to make stored body fat more accessible and starts important cellular repair processes.
 Here are some of the changesTrusted Source that may happen in your body as a result of intermittent fasting:
 • Insulin level: Your blood level of insulin drops significantly, which promotes fat burning.
 • Human growth hormone (HGH) level: Your blood level of HGH may increase dramatically. Higher levels of this hormone promote fat burning and muscle gain and have numerous other benefits.
 • Cellular repair: Your body starts important cellular repair processes such as removing waste material from cells.
 • Gene expression: Beneficial changes occur in several genes and molecules related to longevity and protection against disease.
 Many of the benefits of intermittent fasting are related to these changes in hormones, cellular function, and gene expression.

 you lose weight and visceral fat
 Many people try intermittent fasting in an effort to lose weight.
 Generally, intermittent fasting will make you eat fewer meals. Unless you compensate by eating much more during the other meals, you’ll end up taking in fewer calories.
 Additionally, intermittent fasting enhances hormone function to promote weight loss. Lower insulinTrusted Source levels, higher HGH levels, and increasedTrusted Source levels of norepinephrine all increase the breakdown of body fat and make it easier for your body to use fat for energy.
 For this reason, short-term fasting actually improves your metabolismTrusted Source, helping you burn even more calories.
 In a 2022 studyTrusted Source involving 131 people with obesity, researchers found that those who participated in 12 weeks of intermittent fasting lost an average of 9% of their body weight — more than those who engaged in other weight loss methods.
 But this study focused on the 5:2 intermittent fasting plan, which means the participants ate normally for 5 days and restricted their calories for 2 days each week.
 The authors of a 2020 reviewTrusted Source of 27 studies noted that participants doing intermittent fasting lost 0.8–13% of their baseline body weight.
 In a 2020 trialTrusted Source, researchers focused on people who followed the 16:8 method, which involves fasting for 16 hours per day and eating within an 8-hour window.
 The people who fasted didn’t lose significantly more weight than those who ate three meals per day. But after testing a subset of the participants in person, the researchers found that those who fasted had lost a significant amount of lean mass, including lean muscle.
 More studies are needed to investigate the effect of fasting on muscle loss. But, all things considered, intermittent fasting has the potential to be an incredibly powerful weight loss tool.

In contrast, a 2020 trial on the 16:8 method, where individuals fasted for 16 hours daily and ate within an 8-hour window, did not show significantly more weight loss than eating three meals per day (Under ""you lose weight and visceral fat"").","Hey there! Let's break down intermittent fasting in a simple way.

### What is Intermittent Fasting?

Intermittent fasting isn't about *what* you eat, but *when* you eat. It's an eating pattern where you cycle between periods of eating and periods of not eating (fasting). Think of it as giving your body a regular break from food. There are different ways to do it, like the 16:8 method (fasting for 16 hours and eating during an 8-hour window each day) or the 5:2 method (eating normally for 5 days and restricting calories for 2 days each week).

### What are the Health Benefits of Intermittent Fasting?

When you fast for a while, some really interesting things happen in your body that can lead to a lot of benefits:

1.  **Hormone and Cell Changes:** Your body adjusts hormone levels, making it easier to burn stored fat. For example, your insulin levels drop significantly, which promotes fat burning. Your human growth hormone (HGH) levels can also increase dramatically, which helps with fat burning and muscle gain.
2.  **Cellular Repair:** Your body kicks off important ""housekeeping"" processes, like removing waste material from cells. This is like a deep clean for your body's building blocks!
3.  **Gene Expression:** There can be beneficial changes in genes and molecules linked to living longer and protecting against diseases.
4.  **Heart Health:** It may contribute to a healthier heart.
5.  **Reduced Inflammation:** It can help calm inflammation in your body.
6.  **Fat Burning & Weight Loss:** Many people use intermittent fasting to lose weight. By naturally eating fewer meals, you often consume fewer calories overall. Plus, it boosts hormones (like lower insulin and higher HGH) that make your body better at breaking down and using fat for energy. It can even improve your metabolism, helping you burn more calories.

### Which Method is Most Effective for Weight Loss?

Based on the studies mentioned, it seems that different methods can have varying results:

*   **The 5:2 method** appears to be quite effective for weight loss. In one study, people with obesity who followed the 5:2 plan for 12 weeks lost an average of 9% of their body weight. Other research looking at various intermittent fasting approaches (including 5:2) showed participants losing between 0.8% and 13% of their starting body weight.
*   **The 16:8 method**, while still a popular choice, had a slightly different outcome in one particular trial. In this study, people following the 16:8 method didn't lose significantly more weight than those who ate three meals a day. Interestingly, researchers also found that some participants on the 16:8 method lost a significant amount of lean mass, including muscle.

**In simple terms:** While intermittent fasting is generally a powerful tool for weight loss because it often leads to eating fewer calories and boosts fat-burning hormones, the **5:2 method** seems to have shown more significant weight loss results in studies compared to the 16:8 method, which in some cases, might lead to muscle loss if not managed carefully. More research is still being done, especially on how it affects muscle mass.

It's always a good idea to talk to a healthcare professional before starting any new eating pattern, especially if you have underlying health conditions!"

After the show, Christian Dior began thinking about his design again, in his mind he
thought he had the responsibility to bring fashion to women, and he wanted women
looks like flowers. Because the subversive designing and perfect looking, the dresses
were accepted by most society people through they were expensive in that time. (Marly,
1990) Christian Dior’s wonderful new look made fashion area crazy in that some, some
people liked it very much, others against it. Because of the traditional understanding
about the clothes, some governments thought this kind of clothes wasteful and awful,
they even ordered some factories stop making the clothes.
People who liked Dior’s styles very much, started thinking about against governments,
they came to meet Christian Dior and discussed how they could do to protect the
clothing line. For Christian Dior himself, he believed his new fashion would be popular
by women, he did want return to the old fashion again, and so every 6 months he made
a new line to continue his clothes until reached 22 lines.
A big change was happened in 1957 when the Master’s death stunned the whole
fashion market, he was the creator who made Christian Dior be known. However, the
company could not stop developing, and it became the domination in that time of
fashion marketing.
Dior’s new designs always shocked the fashion marketing after that time it made
Christian Dior’s company became more and more famous. A lot of Dior’s stores
appeared in Paris, Hollywood, New Yorkâ€¦it was well known as a luxury label from that
time all over the world.
For developing and expanding its market, Christian Dior began to add some other
products not only clothes, but also fashion and leather goods, watches and jewelries,
wines and spirits, perfumes and cosmeticsâ€¦
The aims of this article is considering the developed of Dior industry in last few years
from about 2003 to 2009, and trying to find out some strategies for future development
for Dior. And also considered how Christian Dior keeps its predominant in fashion
industries, especially in the similar luxury brands like Louis Vuitton, Armani, Gucci, and
Channel. It is obliviously that if any industry insists on one strategy or old-fashioned
fossilized attitudes in the market, it would be gone out from the market quickly.
The following article will discuss the strategies by four tools, which considered from the
industry life cycle, PESTAL framework, five framework and strategic group to understand
the development of Christian Dior. And through the five tools we also could understand
the different strategies used in different time or under different economic environment.
And at last, conducting a SWOT analysis of Christian Dior also becomes a necessary
step.
Industry Life Cycle:
The products in any industry should have a process which is called industry life cycle in
marketing. Normally, it would separate to four steps: introduction; growth; maturity and
decline. The competition becomes white-hot in the luxury marketing, it is a almost total
mature market. According to the industry life cycle, it should nearly reach or have
already reached the decline step. So, how to change the poison and improve
competitive in fashion marketing become an emergence for Manage groups of Christian
Dior. Strategies of sustainable development are necessary considered by them in this
period.
PESTEL Framework (Political, Economic, Social,
Technological, Environmental and Legal):
Political:
Since some new members joint into European Union, the tariff decline quite a lot, it is a
big effect to Dior’s export and import business. Expanding new business line and
opening new stores in different areas is one of Dior’s most important strategies. It
brought a lot of benefits and challenges to Dior. Reduced price of some products to
improve its competitive to other luxury brands, and expanding its overseas plan,
especially plan in Asian market. The following graph is Dior’s financial report in Europe:

(Source from Christian Dior financial report 2006)
Through this report, it seems under this politics, Dior’s export sales increased about 8%
in one year.
Economic conditions:
In 2008, world financial crisis started from America, the economic condition impacted
every industry quickly. In the first three months of 2009, Christian Dior (2009) stressed
Dior Couture declined about “8% at current exchange rates and of 12% at constant
exchange rates”. The United States and Japan is impacted seriously by the financial
crisis, the Dior’s goods sales decreased obviously in the period. However, the good news
is that sales situation remains strong in China and some Middle East countries. Christian
Dior invested strategies into these new areas to develop itself.
Christian Dior (2009) stated that the manager groups changed their focus on these new
economic powerful countries, and kept the balance between its strengths and
weaknesses. This strategy brought a lot of advantages, and keeps Dior’s dominance
position on the world luxury marketing in 2009.
Social
Christian Dior has a huge range of customers, because it consist its best design and
quality, it created a fashion culture and history for itself. Dior as a label is respected by
many people.
Technological
To improve competition, Christian Dior signed up a contract with John Galliano who is
one of most influential designer in fashion areas. It is a big issue for Dior, and also for
fashion industries. For example Dior watch designed by John Galliano and Victoire de
Castellane in 2005, it impact the trend of Dior’s Fashion style. It is not difficult to image
women would like taking a lot of money in a new style handbag, that means they also
would expend a high price on a fashion watch if it is a new fashion trend in their minds.
Furthermore to open up new avenues of business, Christian Dior began cracking other
business areas. The first step is co-operating with other brands which is famous on other
business industries. For example, On June 2008, Dior co-operated with Apple, created a
dress for Apple’s iphone. It was named “Dior Homme iPhone Holder”, obviously, it was
so expensive, compare with old iPhone, Dior Hommer iPhone Holder cost twice price.
It is the not the first time Christian Dior enter into another total different industry. Then,
Christian Dior collaborate Mode Labs and produced its handset. This handset is called
“My Dior”, and it is extremely expensive, with a 2 Mega pixel camera, a tough screen,
and multimedia goodies. One My Dior’s retail is start from 5000 dollars. And Dior’s
company will come up with its own new mobile later soon. (Troaca, 2008)
Environmental and Legal
Obviously, Christian Dior is Legal company, it keeps abiding by every laws, including
employee’s law; company environment condition; fair competitive law and others.
Because obey these laws are the basic situations to run a company.
Five Forces Framework:
It will follow 5 parts: Competitive Rivalry, Buyer, Suppliers, Substitutes, and Potential
Entrants.
Competitive Rivalry
Some researches show the price is not the most important factor customers would
consider, they are more focus on the value of the products. Like Dior, many rich people
are honest fans of its products through the price is very high. This is a big difference
between normal products and luxury goods. They buy Dior for distinguishing others.
According to the psychology of customers, Dior promoted a strategy from 2003, which
is called limited edition. Dior Company produces some goods with specific design, and
most important point is the company will control the numbers of the goods. It made a
big success until now, every time when Dior creates new limited-good, they will be sold
much quickly than others.
Beside great quality goods, Dior pays a lot of attentions on its services for customers,
Dall’Olmo Riley and Lacroix ( 2000) pointed out that all luxury brands not only focus on
selling goods but also making a great relationship with their customers after sale. All of
these strategies made Dior
Compare with its biggest competitors like Gucci, Armani, and Hermes. Christian Dior got
more benefits in sales within its talent manager groups.

Plant by-products: Alfalfa Meal or Pellets Alfalfa meal or pellets are often used as animal feed. Primarily they are used to increase organic matter in the soil but do provide nutrients and a high availability of trace minerals. They contain trianconatol, a natural fatty acid growth stimulant. Corn Gluten meal Corn Gluten products have a high percentage of nitrogen. It carries a warning to allow 1 to 4 months of decomposition in the soil prior to seeding. Allelopathic properties will inhibit the germination of seeds. However, there is no danger to established or transplanted plants. This product is also marketed as a pre-emergent weed control for annual grasses in bluegrass lawns. Cottonseed meal In warm soils this fertilizer is readily available with little danger of over-fertilizing. Use for acid-loving plants such as rhododendrons, blueberries and azaleas. Seaweed extract Seaweed is a good source of trace metals, micronutrients, amino acids and vitamins plus growth hormones that stimulate plant cell division. It doesn't smell as much as a fish emulsion but is more expensive.  Kelp Meal – a product of the ocean is primarily used as a trace mineral source. It is often combined with fish meal to add N-P-K value  Kelp Powder – similar to kelp meal but ground fine enough to put into solution and applied as a foliar spray or injected into an irrigation system.  Liquid Kelp – usually cold processed, liquid kelp will have higher levels of growth hormones than extracts. Some may be enzymatically digested, making growth hormones even more available to the plants.

Animal by-products: Manures Nutrient concentrations in manures vary widely with the kind of animal they're from. Fresh manure has the highest concentration and can burn tender roots easily. Composted manure is less harsh. Although the concentration of nutrients is lower in manure than in man-made fertilizers, manure improves soil structure and increases its water holding capacity. Blood meal This dried blood from cattle slaughterhouses is a rich source of nitrogen. Do not apply at more than recommended rates because it is concentrated enough to harm plants. Always wear a mask to protect your lungs from dust. Bone Meal Bone meal decomposes slowly and releases phosphorus gradually. Bone meal is good for bulbs that don't sprout for several months after they're planted and for alkaline-loving plants such as clematis, lilac and hydrangea. NOTE: Rarely need phosphorus in the Spokane area. Feather Meal Sourced from poultry slaughter feather meal has high nitrogen (N) levels but is very slow to release the N. Fish emulsion This well-rounded fertilizer consists of partly decomposed ground fish. The smell is strong but will dissipate in a day or two, and can deter pests that don't like the fish smell. It has a high concentration of nitrogen and can burn plants if over-used (especially container plants). Enzymatically digested hydrolyzed liquid fish Enzymatically digested hydrolyzed fish use enzymes to digest the fish wastes instead of using heat and acids (fish emulsion). This retains more of the proteins, enzymes, vitamins and micronutrients than emulsions. Fish meal Fish meal is ground and heat dried fish waste.

The document does not state any similarities between the two.","That's a great question! Both seaweed extract and fish emulsion are fantastic organic fertilizers derived from the ocean, offering unique benefits to your plants. Let's break down how they're similar and different:

### How They're Similar:

*   **Marine Origin:** Both products come from the sea, making them rich in natural compounds that benefit plant life.
*   **Organic Fertilizers:** They are both natural, organic options for nourishing your garden, avoiding synthetic chemicals.
*   **Nutrient Providers:** While their primary nutrient profiles differ, both contribute valuable elements to the soil and plants.
*   **Liquid Application:** They are typically applied as liquids, either diluted for watering plants or as foliar sprays, allowing for quick absorption.

### How They're Different:

1.  **Nutrient Profile & Primary Benefits:**
    *   **Seaweed Extract:** This product is renowned for being a powerhouse of **trace metals, micronutrients, amino acids, vitamins, and especially growth hormones**. These hormones are key to stimulating plant cell division, leading to robust growth, stronger root systems, and improved overall plant health and resilience. It's less about N-P-K and more about comprehensive health and growth stimulation.
    *   **Fish Emulsion:** Made from partly decomposed ground fish, fish emulsion is primarily a **high-nitrogen (N)** fertilizer. This makes it excellent for promoting lush, green foliage and vigorous growth. While it's considered a ""well-rounded"" fertilizer, its nitrogen content is its standout feature.

2.  **Smell:**
    *   **Seaweed Extract:** Generally has a much milder, less offensive smell, often described as a faint sea smell, if any at all. The document notes it ""doesn't smell as much as a fish emulsion.""
    *   **Fish Emulsion:** Famous (or infamous!) for its **strong, distinct fishy odor**. While intense at first, the smell usually dissipates within a day or two after application. A bonus is that this strong smell can sometimes deter pests!

3.  **Cost:**
    *   **Seaweed Extract:** Tends to be **more expensive** than fish emulsion, reflecting its concentrated growth hormones and broad spectrum of micronutrients.
    *   **Fish Emulsion:** Generally a more **budget-friendly** option for a nitrogen boost.

4.  **Risk of Burning Plants:**
    *   **Seaweed Extract:** Because its primary benefit isn't high N-P-K, there's **little to no danger of over-fertilizing or burning plants** when used as directed.
    *   **Fish Emulsion:** Due to its **high concentration of nitrogen**, it carries a warning that it ""can burn plants if over-used (especially container plants)."" Care must be taken to dilute it properly.

5.  **Specific Applications & Forms:**
    *   **Seaweed Extract:** Excellent for overall plant vigor, stress resistance, and stimulating growth at various stages. You might also find related products like Kelp Meal (a trace mineral source, often combined with fish meal for N-P-K) and Liquid Kelp (which can be cold-processed or enzymatically digested for even higher hormone availability).
    *   **Fish Emulsion:** Ideal for plants needing a nitrogen boost, such as leafy greens, corn, or during the vegetative growth phase of many plants. Its strong smell can also act as a pest deterrent. Enzymatically digested hydrolyzed liquid fish is a premium version, retaining more proteins, enzymes, vitamins, and micronutrients than traditional emulsions.

In essence, if you're looking for a powerful **growth stimulant, a broad spectrum of micronutrients, and overall plant resilience** without a strong odor, **seaweed extract** is your go-to. If your plants need a significant **nitrogen boost for lush green growth** and you don't mind a temporary strong smell (which can also deter pests!), **fish emulsion** is an effective and often more economical choice. Many gardeners even use both, leveraging the unique strengths of each!"

study of graduate students David S. Murphy School of Business and Economics, Lynchburg College,
Lynchburg, Virginia, USA, and Scott Yetmar College of Business Administration, Cleveland State
University, Cleveland, Ohio, USA Abstract Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to report on a survey
about the personal financial planning attitudes of MBA students in the USA.
Design/methodology/approach - The study surveyed 206 MBA students about their attitudes to
personal financial planning. Participants were asked about their level of knowledge, whether they had
prepared components of a financial plan, where they might seek assistance in such a process and the
criteria for selecting a financial planner. In addition, participants were asked to indicate their level of
confidence in a financial plan's capacity to help them meet their long-term needs and the likelihood that
they would implement such a plan. Findings - The findings indicate that, while most respondents feel
both that financial planning is important and that they are interested in developing a financial plan, very
few feel that they have the necessary skills and knowledge to prepare their own plan. In addition, the
participants indicated a strong preference for professional personal financial planning advice. The study
also indicates that less than 13 percent have prepared a comprehensive personal financial plan. When
asked to identify the one professional from whom they would seek advice, certified financial planners
were the preferred resource. Research limitations/implications - While the results are not generalizable
to the wider population, the views of this group are important because one might expect that educated
individuals would be both more interested in personal financial planning and more capable of prepaJing
their own plans compaJ'ed with average Americans. Practical implications - The study presents some
implications for practice and financial literacy education from a US perspective. Originality/value - A
perceived need of respondents is to feel that their financial planner will put their needs first. While
some professionals believe this to be the hallmark of ""independence,"" the respondents placed less
impOltance on planner independence. In order to foster client confidence, planners must act in ways
that convey clearly the primacy of their clients' needs. Keywords Graduates, United States of America,
Financial services, Personal finance Paper type Research paper Introduction The need for financial
security, especially during retirement years, has been met historically in the United States (USA) in three
ways: personal savings (including insurance and annuities), social insurance programs like social security
and employersponsored pension programs. Employer-sponsored pension programs have been the
cornerstone of these financial security tools. Consequently, pension programs have been the target of
continual legislative actions. The Employee Retimnent Income and Security Act of 1974 made significant
and wide-sweeping changes that affected most aspects of corporate and self-employed pension
programs (that is, legal, tax, investment and actuarial) and initiated 4010,) programs. These changes
lead to an increase in the popularity of defined-contribution pension plans. Number oj participants

Summary participant 47,558 demographics Attitudes toward planning Participants were asked
specifically whether they thought that preparing a personal financial plan was important; whether they
were interested in preparing such a plan; whether they had time to do so; and whether or not they felt
that they had the necessary skills and knowledge to prepare a personal financial plan. The results of
these four questions are summarized in Table III. It is interesting to note that the percentage of
participants who indicated that they had the skills and knowledge necessary to prepare a personal
financial plan (33 percent) is slightly lower than the percentage of Americans in the University of
Michigan study who had tried to calculate their retirement fund needs (Employee Benefit News, 2005).
Of the 68 participants who indicated that they had the necessary skills and lmowledge to prepare a
personal financial plan, 47 indicated employment in accotmting or finance positions. Only 69 of the
subjects (33.5 percent) indicated that they had prepared a written, comprehensive personal financial
plan. A complete financial plan addresses many issues, some of which are not applicable to all
individuals. Consequently, the participants were also asked to identify plan components that they had
prepared. These results are summarized in Table IV. As evident in Table Iv, the participants in the study
have not prepared many of the components of a comprehensive financial plan. About the same
percentage of participants who reported that they had the skills and knowledge needed to prepare a
financial plan (33 percent) had actually prepared such a plan (33.5 percent). Approximately one in five
participants had prepared an educational funding analysis. Affirmative responses (%) Personal financial

of the respondents. This percentage was divided between CPAlPFS (15.5 percent) and CPAs (3.9
percent). Other financial planning designations (for example, Charted Life Underwriter [CLUJ, Certified
Fund Specialist [CFS] and Charted Financial Consultant [ChFCl) were included in the study but were
selected by only a few participants. Weston (2008) indicates that there are about 250,000 individuals in
the marketplace who identify themselves as financial planners. Of that number, about 56,000 have
earned some kind of professional certification. The CFp® designation appears to be the most popular
with about 58,000 certificate holders (CFP Board, 2008). Participants' reported preference for CFPs® is
consistent with the predominance of CFp® certificate holders in the marketplace. When asked whether
they preferred fee only, fee and compensation or compensation only planners, the majority of
participants (127 or 61.7 percent) indicated that they preferred fee·only planners. Only 30 participants
(14.6 percent) indicated a preference for working with a fee and commission planner while 49 (23.8
percent) indicated that they would seek the advice of a commission only planner. Participants were also
asked to rank six different reasons for selecting a specific planner. The results of their rankings are
shown in Table VI. The most important planner characteristic, as suggested by the participants, is that
the planner places the client's needs first. This predisposition is consistent with the expressed desire by
the majority of the respondents to work with a fee·only planner. The desire that the planner
demonstrates high levels of product familiarity means that fee·only planners must be as familiar with
the products that they recommend, as are commission-only planners. Fee-only planners often use noload funds for plan implementation, products for which they do not receive a commission. Low
transactions costs or the use of commissionfree financial products ranked last in importance among the
participants. Participants ranked freedom of choice third in importance. Thus, it may be important for all
planners to present clients with a menu of choices for plan implementation. Selecting a number of
different funds, for example, with similar risk-return characteristics and time horizons and letting the
client make the final selection may help meet this perceived need. Planner independence and
confidence ranked considerably lower than did meeting clients needs first and product familiarity.
Independence is an attribute often used as a selling point by CPAlPFSs. It appears that this
independence may give them little competitive advantage in the marketplace or at least among
graduate business students. Finally, participants were asked to indicate their level of confidence in a
financial plan's capacity to help them meet their long-term needs (measured on a scale of 1 = not at all
confident to 5 = extremely confident) and the likelihood that they would Criteria Mean ranka SD I want

VI. Planner selection criteria the majority of them do not view their CPAs as potential providers of
financial planning advice. Very few of the respondents indicated that they would seek the advice of CFS,
ChFC or CLU. These are designations normally held by insurance professionals. This also is surprising
because the most frequently mentioned professional relationship was with an insurance agent. Indeed,
40.7 percent of the respondents had established such a relationship. It appears that both the insurance
and public accounting professions have not had the same success in promoting members of their
professions as personal financial planners. A perceived need by the respondents to feel that their
financial planner will put the client's needs first is clearly apparent in Table VI. While some professionals
may feel that this is the hallmark of ""independence"", the respondents placed much less importance on a
planner's independence. Thus, to foster a client's confidence, planners must act in ways that very clearly
convey the message to the client that their needs are paramount. References CFP Board of Standards

What were the results of the study?","The findings of the study indicate several key points:
*   While most respondents believe financial planning is important and are interested in developing a financial plan, very few feel they possess the necessary skills and knowledge to prepare their own plan (""Findings"").
*   Participants showed a strong preference for professional personal financial planning advice (""Findings"").
*   Less than 13 percent of participants had prepared a comprehensive personal financial plan (""Findings"").
*   When asked to identify the one professional from whom they would seek advice, certified financial planners were the preferred resource (""Findings"").","This study, which surveyed 206 MBA students in the USA about their personal financial planning attitudes, revealed several interesting findings:

**Overall Attitudes and Preparedness:**

*   **Importance and Interest:** A significant majority of respondents (75.7%) felt that preparing a personal financial plan was important, and 67% were interested in developing one.
*   **Lack of Skills and Time:** Despite their interest, very few felt they had the necessary skills and knowledge to prepare their own financial plan (only 33%). Even fewer (40%) felt they had the time to do so.
*   **Limited Comprehensive Planning:** The study found that a small percentage (33.5%) had actually prepared a written, comprehensive personal financial plan. When looking at individual components, many participants had not prepared key parts of a financial plan. For example, only about one in five had prepared an educational funding analysis.

**Seeking Professional Advice:**

*   **Strong Preference for Professionals:** Participants indicated a strong preference for professional personal financial planning advice.
*   **Preferred Professional:** When asked to identify the *one* professional they would seek advice from, Certified Financial Planners (CFP®) were the preferred resource.
*   **Planner Compensation Preference:** The majority of participants (61.7%) preferred working with ""fee-only"" planners, meaning they pay a direct fee for advice rather than the planner earning commissions on products. Only 14.6% preferred ""fee and commission"" planners, and 23.8% would seek advice from ""commission-only"" planners.
*   **Surprising Findings on Other Professionals:**
    *   While many respondents had relationships with insurance agents (40.7%), very few indicated they would seek financial planning advice from professionals with insurance-related designations like CLU, CFS, or ChFC.
    *   Similarly, while a portion selected Accountants (CPAs) or CPAs with Personal Financial Specialist (PFS) designation, the majority did not view their CPAs as primary providers of financial planning advice.

**Criteria for Selecting a Planner:**

*   **Client Needs First:** The most important characteristic for participants when selecting a planner was the assurance that the planner would *put their needs first*. This aligns with their preference for fee-only planners.
*   **Product Familiarity:** The second most important criterion was the planner's familiarity with products. This suggests a desire for comprehensive knowledge from the advisor.
*   **Freedom of Choice:** Participants also valued ""freedom of choice in product selection"" as a significant factor.
*   **Lower Importance of Independence:** Interestingly, ""planner independence"" and ""confidence in recommendations"" ranked considerably lower than putting client needs first and product familiarity. This suggests that while independence is often marketed by professionals, clients prioritize trust and expertise more directly.
*   **Reduced Transaction Costs:** ""Reduced transaction costs or the use of commission-free financial products"" ranked last in importance among the participants.

In essence, the study highlighted that while these educated individuals recognize the importance of financial planning, they largely feel unequipped to do it themselves and have a clear preference for professional, client-focused advice, especially from CFPs operating on a fee-only basis."

Your business structure affects how much you pay in taxes, your ability to raise money, the paperwork you need to file, and your personal liability. 
 

 You'll need to choose a business structure before you register your business with the state. Most businesses will also need to get a tax ID number and file for the appropriate licenses and permits.
 

 Choose carefully. While you may convert to a different business structure in the future, there may be restrictions based on your location. This could also result in tax consequences and unintended dissolution, among other complications. 
 

 Consulting with business counselors, attorneys, and accountants can prove helpful.
 

 Review common business structures
 Sole proprietorship
 A sole proprietorship is easy to form and gives you complete control of your business. You're automatically considered to be a sole proprietorship if you do business activities but don't register as any other kind of business. 
 

 Sole proprietorships do not produce a separate business entity. This means your business assets and liabilities are not separate from your personal assets and liabilities. You can be held personally liable for the debts and obligations of the business. Sole proprietors are still able to get a trade name. It can also be hard to raise money because you can't sell stock, and banks are hesitant to lend to sole proprietorships.
 

 Sole proprietorships can be a good choice for low-risk businesses and owners who want to test their business idea before forming a more formal business.
 

 Partnership
 Partnerships are the simplest structure for two or more people to own a business together. There are two common kinds of partnerships: limited partnerships (LP) and limited liability partnerships (LLP).
 

 Limited partnerships have only one general partner with unlimited liability, and all other partners have limited liability. The partners with limited liability also tend to have limited control over the company, which is documented in a partnership agreement. Profits are passed through to personal tax returns, and the general partner — the partner without limited liability — must also pay self-employment taxes.
 

 Limited liability partnerships are similar to limited partnerships, but give limited liability to every owner. An LLP protects each partner from debts against the partnership, they won't be responsible for the actions of other partners. 
 

 Partnerships can be a good choice for businesses with multiple owners, professional groups (like attorneys), and groups who want to test their business idea before forming a more formal business.
 

 Limited liability company (LLC) 
 An LLC lets you take advantage of the benefits of both the corporation and partnership business structures.
 

 LLCs protect you from personal liability in most instances, your personal assets — like your vehicle, house, and savings accounts — won't be at risk in case your LLC faces bankruptcy or lawsuits.
 Profits and losses can get passed through to your personal income without facing corporate taxes. However, members of an LLC are considered self-employed and must pay self-employment tax contributions towards Medicare and Social Security.
 

 LLCs can have a limited life in many states. When a member joins or leaves an LLC, some states may require the LLC to be dissolved and re-formed with new membership — unless there's already an agreement in place within the LLC for buying, selling, and transferring ownership.
 

 LLCs can be a good choice for medium- or higher-risk businesses, owners with significant personal assets they want protected, and owners who want to pay a lower tax rate than they would with a corporation.
 

 Corporation
 C corp
 A corporation, sometimes called a C corp, is a legal entity that's separate from its owners. Corporations can make a profit, be taxed, and can be held legally liable.
 

 Corporations offer the strongest protection to its owners from personal liability, but the cost to form a corporation is higher than other structures. Corporations also require more extensive record-keeping, operational processes, and reporting.
 

 Unlike sole proprietors, partnerships, and LLCs, corporations pay income tax on their profits. In some cases, corporate profits are taxed twice — first, when the company makes a profit, and again when dividends are paid to shareholders on their personal tax returns.
 

 Corporations have a completely independent life separate from its shareholders. If a shareholder leaves the company or sells his or her shares, the C corp can continue doing business relatively undisturbed.
 

 Corporations have an advantage when it comes to raising capital because they can raise funds through the sale of stock, which can also be a benefit in attracting employees.
 

 Corporations can be a good choice for medium- or higher-risk businesses, those that need to raise money, and businesses that plan to ""go public"" or eventually be sold.
 

 S corp
 An S corporation, sometimes called an S corp, is a special type of corporation that's designed to avoid the double taxation drawback of regular C corps. S corps allow profits, and some losses, to be passed through directly to owners' personal income without ever being subject to corporate tax rates.
 

 Not all states tax S corps equally, but most recognize them the same way the federal government does and tax the shareholders accordingly. Some states tax S corps on profits above a specified limit and other states don't recognize the S corp election at all, simply treating the business as a C corp.
 

 S corps must file with the IRS to get S corp status, a different process from registering with their state.
 

 There are special limits on S corps. Check the IRS website for eligibility requirements(Link is external). You'll still have to follow the strict filing and operational processes of a C corp.
 

 S corps also have an independent life, just like C corps. If a shareholder leaves the company or sells his or her shares, the S corp can continue doing business relatively undisturbed.
 

 S corps can be a good choice for a businesses that would otherwise be a C corp, but meet the criteria to file as an S corp
 

 

 Compare business structures
 Compare the general traits of these business structures, but remember that ownership rules, liability, taxes, and filing requirements for each business structure can vary by state. The following table is intended only as a guideline. Please confer with a business tax specialist to confirm your specific business needs.

 Sole proprietorship One person Unlimited personal liability 
 Self-employment tax

What are the main differences between owning an LLC or Sole proprietorship? Which is better for a small business? what are the steps I would have to take to get either one?","The main differences between owning an LLC and a Sole proprietorship are related to liability, ownership, and how they are formed:

*   **Liability**: A sole proprietorship does not separate business and personal assets, meaning the owner can be held personally liable for business debts and obligations (""Sole proprietorship"" section, ""Compare business structures"" table). In contrast, an LLC generally protects owners from personal liability, ensuring personal assets like vehicles, houses, and savings accounts are not at risk in cases of bankruptcy or lawsuits (""Limited liability company (LLC)"" section, ""Compare business structures"" table).
*   **Formation/Entity Status**: A sole proprietorship is automatically formed if business activities are conducted without registering as another business type, and it does not create a separate business entity (""Sole proprietorship"" section). The document implies LLCs require registration with the state (""You'll need to choose a business structure before you register your business with the state."").
*   **Ownership**: A sole proprietorship is owned by one person (""Compare business structures"" table). An LLC can be owned by one or more people (""Compare business structures"" table).
*   **Raising Money**: It can be difficult for sole proprietorships to raise money because they cannot sell stock, and banks may be hesitant to lend to them (""Sole proprietorship"" section). The document does not explicitly state how LLCs raise money.
*   **Taxes**: Both sole proprietorships and LLC members are considered self-employed and must pay self-employment tax (""Compare business structures"" table, ""Limited liability company (LLC)"" section). LLCs pass profits and losses through to personal income without facing corporate taxes (""Limited liability company (LLC)"" section).

Regarding which is better for a small business:
*   A sole proprietorship ""can be a good choice for low-risk businesses and owners who want to test their business idea before forming a more formal business"" (""Sole proprietorship"" section).
*   An LLC ""can be a good choice for medium- or higher-risk businesses, owners with significant personal assets they want protected, and owners who want to pay a lower tax rate than they would with a corporation"" (""Limited liability company (LLC)"" section).
The document does not definitively state which is ""better"" for a small business, as the suitability depends on factors like risk, personal asset protection needs, and the owner's desire to test a business idea.

Regarding the steps to get either one:
*   For a sole proprietorship, you are ""automatically considered to be a sole proprietorship if you do business activities but don't register as any other kind of business"" (""Sole proprietorship"" section). Sole proprietors can also ""get a trade name"" (""Sole proprietorship"" section).
*   For an LLC, the document states generally that businesses need to ""register your business with the state,"" ""get a tax ID number,"" and ""file for the appropriate licenses and permits"" (""You'll need to choose a business structure before you register your business with the state.""). However, the specific steps for forming an LLC are not detailed.","It sounds like you're thinking about starting a small business, which is fantastic! Choosing the right business structure is a really important first step that impacts everything from your taxes to your personal liability. Let's break down the differences between a Sole Proprietorship and a Limited Liability Company (LLC), which one might be better for a small business, and what you'd need to do to set them up.

### Main Differences Between an LLC and a Sole Proprietorship

Here are the key distinctions:

1.  **Legal Entity Status:**
    *   **Sole Proprietorship:** This is the simplest structure because your business is **not a separate legal entity** from you. You and your business are one and the same in the eyes of the law. If you start selling goods or services without registering any other way, you're automatically a sole proprietorship.
    *   **LLC (Limited Liability Company):** An LLC **is a separate legal entity** from its owners. This separation is a crucial difference and offers significant advantages.

2.  **Personal Liability:** This is perhaps the biggest difference!
    *   **Sole Proprietorship:** You have **unlimited personal liability**. This means there's no legal distinction between your business assets and your personal assets (like your house, car, or personal savings). If your business incurs debt, faces a lawsuit, or has other obligations, your personal assets are at risk.
    *   **LLC:** LLCs offer **personal liability protection**. In most cases, your personal assets are shielded from the business's debts, bankruptcies, or lawsuits. If the LLC faces financial trouble, your personal vehicle, house, and savings accounts generally won't be at risk.

3.  **Formation and Complexity:**
    *   **Sole Proprietorship:** It's incredibly **easy to form**. As mentioned, you're automatically considered one if you just start doing business activities without registering as anything else. The administrative burden is very low.
    *   **LLC:** Requires **more formal steps** to form. You must register your business with the state, which usually involves filing ""Articles of Organization"" and can involve more paperwork and fees than a sole proprietorship.

4.  **Taxation:**
    *   **Sole Proprietorship:** Profits and losses are ""passed through"" to your personal tax return. You report business income and expenses on Schedule C of your personal 1040 tax form. You'll also be responsible for **self-employment taxes** (contributions to Social Security and Medicare).
    *   **LLC:** By default, single-member LLCs are also ""pass-through"" entities, meaning profits and losses are reported on your personal tax return (similar to a sole proprietorship, often using Schedule C). Multi-member LLCs are taxed like partnerships. All members of an LLC are considered self-employed and must also pay **self-employment tax contributions**.

5.  **Ability to Raise Money:**
    *   **Sole Proprietorship:** It can be **hard to raise money** because you can't sell stock, and banks are often hesitant to lend to sole proprietorships due to the lack of legal separation.
    *   **LLC:** While not as advantageous as a corporation for raising capital by selling stock, an LLC's separate legal status can make it appear more formal and credible than a sole proprietorship, potentially making it slightly easier to secure loans or attract investors, though it still has limitations compared to corporations.

6.  **Ownership Structure:**
    *   **Sole Proprietorship:** Owned by **one person**.
    *   **LLC:** Can be owned by **one or more people** (members).

### Which is Better for a Small Business?

The ""better"" choice really depends on the **nature of your business and your personal risk tolerance**:

*   **Sole Proprietorship might be a good choice for you if:**
    *   You're starting a **low-risk business** (e.g., a freelance writer, consultant, or crafter selling online with minimal physical risk).
    *   You want to **test your business idea** before committing to a more formal structure.
    *   You prioritize **ease of setup and minimal administrative burden**.
    *   You have **few personal assets** you're worried about losing, or you're comfortable with the personal liability.

*   **An LLC might be a good choice for you if:**
    *   You're starting a **medium- or higher-risk business** (e.g., anything involving physical products, customer interactions, employees, or significant contracts).
    *   You have **significant personal assets** you want to protect from business debts or lawsuits.
    *   You want your business to have a **more professional and credible image**.
    *   You plan to have **multiple owners** or want the flexibility to easily add them in the future.
    *   You're comfortable with slightly more paperwork and filing requirements for the added legal protection.

For **most small businesses that have any level of risk or that plan to grow beyond a very small scale, an LLC is generally recommended** due to the crucial personal liability protection it offers. It provides peace of mind that your personal life won't be completely entangled with your business struggles.

### Steps to Get Either One

The steps are quite different for each:

**To Get a Sole Proprietorship:**

1.  **Start Doing Business:** That's it! As the document says, you're automatically considered a sole proprietorship if you engage in business activities without registering as another entity. You literally just start offering your goods or services.
2.  **Get a Trade Name (Optional):** If you want to operate under a name different from your own legal name (e.g., ""Sarah's Creative Crafts"" instead of ""Sarah Jones""), you'll likely need to register a ""Doing Business As"" (DBA) or ""fictitious name"" with your county or state.
3.  **Obtain Necessary Licenses and Permits:** Depending on your industry and location, you'll still need to get any required federal, state, or local business licenses and permits. For example, a food business will need health permits.
4.  **Get a Tax ID Number (EIN - Employer Identification Number) (Optional, but often recommended):** If you plan to hire employees, you *must* get an EIN from the IRS. Even if you don't have employees, you might want one to separate your business finances from your personal Social Security number, especially when opening a business bank account.

**To Get an LLC:**

1.  **Choose a Business Name:** Select a unique name for your LLC that complies with your state's naming requirements (e.g., typically including ""LLC"" or ""Limited Liability Company""). You'll want to check for availability with your state's Secretary of State or equivalent agency.
2.  **Appoint a Registered Agent:** You'll need to designate a registered agent in the state where your LLC is formed. This person or entity will receive official legal and tax documents on behalf of your LLC.
3.  **File Articles of Organization with the State:** This is the primary step. You must prepare and file ""Articles of Organization"" (sometimes called a Certificate of Formation) with the Secretary of State (or equivalent office) in the state where you plan to do business. This document officially creates your LLC.
4.  **Create an Operating Agreement (Highly Recommended):** While not always legally required by the state, an operating agreement is a crucial internal document. It outlines the ownership structure, roles, responsibilities, and operating procedures for your LLC. This is especially important if you have multiple members.
5.  **Get an Employer Identification Number (EIN):** Even if you're a single-member LLC with no employees, you'll almost certainly need an EIN from the IRS. Banks typically require it to open a business bank account, and it's essential for tax purposes.
6.  **Obtain Necessary Licenses and Permits:** Just like a sole proprietorship, your LLC will need to obtain any federal, state, and local business licenses and permits relevant to your industry and location.
7.  **Open Business Bank Accounts:** It's critical for liability protection to keep your LLC's finances separate from your personal finances. Open dedicated business checking and savings accounts.

In summary, for a small business, a Sole Proprietorship is the easiest to start but offers no personal protection. An LLC provides invaluable personal liability protection but requires a bit more upfront effort and formal maintenance. It's always a great idea to **consult with business counselors, attorneys, and accountants** to determine the best structure for your specific situation and ensure you meet all legal and tax obligations."

Each year, millions of Americans purchase tickets for live entertainment events, such as
concerts, theatrical performances, and sporting events. In 2023, about 81 million fans in
North America and 145 million fans across the world attended events that were produced
by Live Nation Entertainment—a firm that promotes events, owns venues, and provides ticketing
services through its subsidiary, Ticketmaster.1
IBISWorld, a market research firm, projects
revenue for online ticket sales in the United States in 2024 will be $12.7 billion, with $4.2 billion
(33.3%) spent on sporting events; $3.9 billion (30.7%) on concerts; and $1.5 billion (11.8%) on
dance, opera, and theatrical performances.2
Congress has held hearings,
3
debated bills, and passed legislation4
related to tickets for live events
(Appendix). Some Members of the 118th Congress have called attention to event ticketing issues,
such as rising ticket prices (potentially due to higher ticketing service fees), and efforts to
increase consumer protection (e.g., by requiring full price disclosure for tickets from the
beginning of a transaction).
5 Some states have enacted legislation related to event ticketing,
including legislation that seeks to address these same concerns.
6
This report provides an overview of event ticketing and actions taken by the federal government
related to event ticketing. It also discusses selected legislative proposals from the 118th Congress.
Overview of Event Ticketing and Selected Issues
Tickets for live events initially are sold in the primary market. In the primary market, firms that
provide ticketing services (i.e., ticketers) work directly with venues, promoters, producers, sports
teams, and other entities to sell tickets to consumers (see Figure 1). Most tickets in the primary
market are sold online,7
although some tickets may be available through other outlets, such as a
local box office or call center.8 Events typically have one primary ticketer selling tickets online.
For example, the primary ticketer for most Major League Baseball (MLB) teams is Tickets.com

Commerce Committee, Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, In the Dark: Lack of Transparency in the Live
Event Ticketing Industry, hearing, 116th Cong., 2nd sess., February 26, 2020, https://docs.house.gov/Committee/

4 The 114th Congress passed the Better Online Ticket Sales Act of 2016 (BOTS Act; P.L. 114-274). For more
information about the BOTS Act, see “Federal Oversight of Event Ticketing.”
5 Senate Judiciary hearing, That’s the Ticket.
6 For example, some states require the total price of a ticket, including any taxes and fees, to be provided when the
price is initially displayed (e.g., Connecticut General Statute §53-289a, Georgia Code Annotated §43-4B-28(a)(3), and
New York Arts and Cultural Affairs Law §25.23).
7 For example, in 2022, Live Nation estimated that it sold 56%, 42%, and 2% of its tickets through mobile apps,
websites, and ticket outlets, respectively. Live Nation Entertainment, Inc., SEC Form 10-K for the year ending

Tickets for Live Entertainment Events
Congressional Research Service 2
(a subsidiary of MLB Advanced Media),9
and the primary ticketer for most National Football
League (NFL) teams is Ticketmaster.
10 A portion of tickets might be sold through presales (e.g.,
an artist’s fan club or season tickets), bundled together as a package (e.g., group tickets), or held
for certain individuals (e.g., sponsors, media, high-profile guests).
11 Some live event tickets might
be nontransferable—consumers might be required to show the credit or debit card that was used
to make the purchase and a matching photo ID to enter the event.12
Tickets for some live events also are available in the secondary market. In the secondary market,
individuals who purchased tickets in the primary market can resell their tickets, typically using
ticketers that operate in the secondary market. Individuals selling tickets in the secondary market
can include consumers who cannot or no longer wish to attend the event, as well as ticket brokers
who purchase tickets in the primary market with the intention of reselling them in the secondary
market for a profit. Some event organizers provide tickets directly to ticket brokers.
13 Thus, an
event can have multiple individuals using different secondary ticketers.

USER REQUEST:
Why might a ticket be available in the secondary market?","A ticket might be available in the secondary market if individuals who purchased tickets in the primary market resell them because they cannot or no longer wish to attend the event, or if ticket brokers purchase tickets in the primary market with the intention of reselling them for a profit in the secondary market. Additionally, some event organizers provide tickets directly to ticket brokers (Congressional Research Service, p. 2).","Tickets for live events can end up in the secondary market for a few different reasons, often involving individuals or entities looking to resell tickets they initially acquired.

Here are the main reasons why a ticket might be available in the secondary market:

*   **Change of plans by consumers:** Sometimes, people who bought tickets in the primary market find themselves unable to attend the event due to unforeseen circumstances or simply change their minds. In these cases, they'll resell their tickets on the secondary market to recoup their costs.
*   **Ticket brokers seeking profit:** A significant portion of tickets in the secondary market are sold by ticket brokers. These individuals or businesses strategically purchase tickets in the primary market with the express intention of reselling them later at a higher price for a profit. They operate by anticipating demand and market value.
*   **Direct allocation to brokers by event organizers:** In some instances, event organizers might directly provide tickets to ticket brokers. This can happen for various reasons and ultimately contributes to those tickets being available for resale in the secondary market.

So, whether it's a fan who can no longer make it or a professional broker looking to capitalize on demand, the secondary market serves as a platform for tickets to find new owners after their initial sale."

FIRST GOLDEN RULE
A CUSTOMER IN NEED
IS A CUSTOMER INDEED
When there is not much
difference between your product
and the product of your
competitor, there needs to be a
BIG difference in the quality of
service you provide your
customer.
SECOND GOLDEN RULE
HIRE PEOPLE WITH

D -- 4
E -- 5
Attitude
equals
100%.
ATTITUDE IS A LITTLE THING
THAT MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE
HOW TO HIRE GREAT
EMPLOYEES:
Seek out the great employees who already
work for you. Interview them, find out what
makes them tick. Write profiles of great
employees. Find out what qualities they have
in common. Then look to hire people with the
same qualities.
THIRD GOLDEN RULE
TRAIN YOUR
EMPLOYEES ON STORE
POLICIES
BE THE EXAMPLE FOR
YOUR EMPLOYEES TO
EMULATE.
DON’T ASK YOUR
EMPLOYEES TO DO
SOMETHING YOU
WOULDN’T.
EXAMPLE POLICIES
• Visit with customers
• No whispering
• Walk the customer to product
• Don’t get in the customer’s way when
working in the aisles
• 10 ft rule – Greet the customer
• 2 is company but 3 is a crowd – more than
two in line call for help
• 3 sacks = mandatory carry out
• Thank the Customer no matter what
FOURTH GOLDEN RULE
CROSS TRAIN YOUR
EMPLOYEES
Provide opportunities for employees
to learn.
The kind of employees you want are the
kind who want to learn. Good workers
improve their skills in many areas of work
and life. They can either do it on their own,
and be more inclined to go elsewhere for
continued challenge and learning, or they
can learn under your auspices, and
develop close ties to your organization
while they do.
• Communicate the task. Describe exactly what
you want done, when you want it done, and
what end results you expect.
• Furnish context for the task. Explain why the
task needs to be done, its importance in the
overall scheme of things, and possible
complications that may arise during its
performance
• Determine standards. Agree on the standards
that you will use to measure the success of a
task's completion. These standards should be
realistic and attainable.
FIFTH GOLDEN RULE
TRAIN YOUR
EMPLOYEES HOW TO
BUILD RAPPORT WITH
THE CUSTOMER
Teach your employees how to create
excellent customer service through
human interaction
• All customers are greeted politely and
courteously.
• Create an atmosphere of friendliness
throughout each customer interaction.
• Professionalism is displayed through word
and deeds.
• Show empathy and understanding for a
customer with a problem
• All customers are treated fairly in every
interaction with the store
• Conduct yourself with tact
SIXTH GOLDEN RULE
KNOW YOUR CUSTOMERS
NAMES AND USE THEM

Use the following to build positive
relationships with your customers
• KIDS NAMES
• ACHIEVEMENTS
• HONOR ROLL
• MARRIAGE
• NEW CAR
• HAIR STYLE CHANGE
**STAY AWAY FROM PERSONAL
SENSITIVE SUBJECTS
EVERYONE HAS AN INVISIBLE
SIGN HANGING FROM HIS OR
HER NECK THAT READS
“MAKE ME FEEL
IMPORTANT,”
NEVER FORGET THIS WHEN
WORKING WITH PEOPLE.
SEVENTH GOLDEN RULE
TRAIN YOUR
EMPLOYEES HOW TO
ASK OPEN ENDED
QUESTIONS
Open-ended questions are questions
that encourage people to talk about
whatever is important to them. They help
to establish rapport, gather
information, and increase
understanding. They are the opposite of
closed-ended
questions that typically require a simple
brief response such “yes” or “no.”
Examples of open-ended
questions:
• How can I be of help?
• · Would you tell me more about ___?
• · Could you help me understand ___?
• · What are the good things and the less good
things about ___?
• · What do you think you will lose if you give up
___?
• · What have you tried before?
• · What do you want to do next?
Affirmations
Affirmations are statements and gestures that recognize client
strengths and acknowledge behaviors that lead in the direction of
positive change, no matter how big or small. Affirmations build
confidence in one’s ability to change. To be effective,
affirmations must be genuine and congruent.
Examples of affirmation statements:
· Thank you for …
· I really like the way you …
· That was a very creative how you …
· You showed a lot of self-control in the way you …
· It may not seem like much, but I think it was very impressive
how you …
· You have a real gift for …
“TO GIVE REAL SERVICE YOU MUST
ADD SOMETHING WHICH CANNOT BE
BOUGHT OR MEASURED WITH
MONEY, AND THAT IS SINCERITY AND
INTEGRITY”
-Donald A. Adams
EIGHTH GOLDEN RULE
INSTILL A SENSE OF
URGENCY IN HELPING
CUSTOMERS
WHAT DO THESE CUSTOMERS
HAVE IN COMMON?
EDUCATE YOUR EMPLOYEES
ON FIVE PRINCIPLES OF A
GOOD EMPLOYEE
• URGENCY
• OWNERSHIP
• LEARN-BY-DOING
• LIFELONG LEARNING
• MOTIVATION
Customers don’t expect you to be perfect. They do expect
you to fix things when they go wrong
NINTH GOLDEN RULE
TRAIN YOUR
EMPLOYEES HOW TO
HANDLE ANGRY
CUSTOMERS
NEVER ARGUE WITH A
CUSTOMER
.
LISTEN!
CLOSE YOUR MOUTH
AND LISTEN!!
WHEN THAT DOESN’T
WORK…….

Saying I’m
sorry will
often times
reduce anger.
Apologies
even if it was
not your fault.
Defusing Angry Customers using
the LARSON approach
• Listen let them vent. Empathize, take notes
• Agreement find areas of agreement
• Repeat/Restate use the customers words for
clarification of issue
• Seek Resolution Ask what can be done to
resolve the problem
• Offer a sincere apology We’re sorry this
happened and if were responsible we will
make it right
• Now solve the problem immediately
THE FOUR R’S
• REPEAT
• REVIEW
• RESPOND
• RESOLVE
TENTH GOLDEN RULE
DON’T LET AN ANGRY
CUSTOMER LEAVE
YOUR STORE
10 WAYS TO BUILD
CUSTOMER LOYALTY
1. Take ownership of your customer’s problem.
Even if you are not the cause of it.
2. Follow up with every customer who was upset
or had a difficult problem.
3. Ask yourself with every customer interaction
you have, “If this were me, what would I want?”
4. Thank your customers and co-workers every
chance you get!
5. Fax articles or other materials to your
customers if you think they can benefit from
the information.
10 WAYS TO BUILD
CUSTOMER LOYALTY (Continued)
6. Remember personal details about your customers
such as birthdays, children’s names and
accomplishments.
7. SMILE every time you are on the telephone.
8. Look for ways to bend the rules and remove
service obstacles.
9. Time is a person’s most precious commodity.
Respect your customer’s time and schedule.
10. Provide your customers with respect, friendliness,
and knowledge, and oh, yes, the products and
services you sell.

What are the Golden Rules of Great Customer Service?","The Golden Rules to Great Customer Service are:
1.  A customer in need is a customer indeed (GOLDEN RULES TO GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE).
2.  Hire people with good customer skills (GOLDEN RULES TO GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE).
3.  Train your employees on store policies (GOLDEN RULES TO GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE).

9.  Train your employees how to handle angry customers (GOLDEN RULES TO GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE).
10. Don’t let an unhappy customer leave your store (GOLDEN RULES TO GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE).","Hey there! It's super important to understand what makes great customer service, and this document lays out some fantastic ""Golden Rules"" to achieve just that. These rules are presented by Bill Huninghake & Rich York and aim to transform how businesses interact with their customers.

At the heart of it all is **The Golden Rule**: ""Do unto others as you would have them do unto you."" This timeless principle sets the foundation for all the subsequent customer service guidelines.

Here are the ten specific Golden Rules for Great Customer Service, according to the document:

1.  **A CUSTOMER IN NEED IS A CUSTOMER INDEED.**
    This rule emphasizes that when products or services are similar to competitors, the quality of service becomes the *biggest* differentiator. It's about recognizing the value of a customer, especially when they need help.

2.  **HIRE PEOPLE WITH GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE SKILLS.**
    The document highlights that ""Attitude equals 100%!"" It suggests finding out what makes your current great employees tick, profiling those qualities, and then hiring new people who possess similar traits.

3.  **TRAIN YOUR EMPLOYEES ON STORE POLICIES.**
    Leaders should be the example, never asking employees to do something they wouldn't. This includes policies like greeting customers (the ""10 ft rule""), walking customers to products, and always thanking them.

4.  **CROSS TRAIN YOUR EMPLOYEES.**
    Provide opportunities for employees to learn different roles. This not only develops their skills but also strengthens their ties to your organization, preventing them from seeking growth elsewhere.

5.  **TRAIN YOUR EMPLOYEES HOW TO BUILD RAPPORT WITH THE CUSTOMER.**
    Teach employees to create excellent customer service through human interaction, ensuring all customers are greeted politely, treated fairly, and that empathy and professionalism are always displayed.

6.  **KNOW YOUR CUSTOMERS NAMES AND USE THEM.**
    Using customers' names (and even their kids' names, acknowledging achievements like honor roll, or new cars – while *avoiding sensitive subjects*) makes them feel important. As the document states, ""Everyone has an invisible sign hanging from his or her neck that reads 'MAKE ME FEEL IMPORTANT'.""

7.  **TRAIN YOUR EMPLOYEES HOW TO ASK OPEN ENDED QUESTIONS.**
    Encourage questions that prompt customers to talk more, like ""How can I be of help?"" or ""Would you tell me more about ___?"" These help build rapport, gather information, and increase understanding, unlike simple ""yes/no"" questions.

8.  **INSTILL A SENSE OF URGENCY IN HELPING CUSTOMERS.**
    Customers don't expect perfection, but they do expect you to fix things when they go wrong, and to do so with urgency. Employees should embody principles like ownership, learn-by-doing, and lifelong learning.

9.  **TRAIN YOUR EMPLOYEES HOW TO HANDLE ANGRY CUSTOMERS.**
    The key here is to **NEVER ARGUE**. Instead, employees should listen, empathize, apologize (even if it's not their fault), and use approaches like LARSON (Listen, Agreement, Repeat/Restate, Seek Resolution, Offer sincere apology, Now solve the problem).

10. **DON’T LET AN UNHAPPY CUSTOMER LEAVE YOUR STORE.**
    This rule is about taking ownership of problems, following up with upset customers, asking ""What would I want if this were me?"", and finding ways to bend rules to remove obstacles. It emphasizes respecting customer time, and providing respect, friendliness, and knowledge.

By following these Golden Rules, businesses can not only improve customer retention but also foster a positive, friendly environment that attracts new customers and builds strong community ties. It's truly about controlling your own destiny by prioritizing sincere and high-quality service!"

Please answer the following based on the legal specifications: what happens if there is a price change or conflict in a promotion?","If there is a price change, the price charged for a product or service will be the price in effect at the time the order is placed and will be set out in your order confirmation email, with price increases only applying to orders placed after such changes (Page 1, Section 3 (a)).

If there is a conflict between the terms for a promotion and the general Terms and Conditions, the promotion terms will govern (Page 2, Section 3 (b)).","It's a good idea to understand how Lazarus Naturals handles pricing, especially with changes and promotions, to avoid any surprises! Here's a breakdown based on their legal specifications:

**What happens if there is a price change?**

*   **Prices can change:** All prices, discounts, and promotions on the website are subject to change without prior notice.
*   **Your order is locked in:** The price you'll pay for a product or service is the price that was *in effect at the time you placed your order*. This confirmed price will be clearly stated in your order confirmation email.
*   **Future changes don't affect past orders:** If prices increase, those increases will only apply to orders placed *after* the change occurs. Your existing order won't be impacted.
*   **Errors can be corrected:** While they strive for accuracy, Lazarus Naturals reserves the right to correct any typographical errors, inaccuracies, or omissions related to pricing (or availability) at any time. If such an error leads to an order, they also reserve the right to cancel that order.

**What happens if there's a conflict in a promotion?**

*   **Promotions have their own rules:** Lazarus Naturals may offer special promotions on their website that affect pricing. These promotions are governed by their own specific terms and conditions, which are separate from the general Terms and Conditions of the website.
*   **Promotion terms take precedence:** If there's ever a disagreement or conflict between the specific terms for a particular promotion and the general Terms and Conditions, **the promotion terms will always take precedence and govern your purchase.** So, if a promotion says one thing about pricing or discounts and the general terms say another, the promotion's specific rules will apply.

In essence, the price you see and agree to at the moment of placing your order is generally what you'll pay, and for any special deals, the specific rules of that promotion will be the final word. Always double-check your order confirmation for the final price!"

C. Reasonable Expectation of Profits Derived from Efforts of Others Usually, the main issue in analyzing a digital asset under the Howey test is whether a purchaser has a reasonable expectation of profits (or other financial returns) derived from the efforts of others.  A purchaser may expect to realize a return through participating in distributions or through other methods of realizing appreciation on the asset, such as selling at a gain in a secondary market.  When a promoter, sponsor, or other third party (or affiliated group of third parties) (each, an “Active Participant” or “AP”) provides essential managerial efforts that affect the success of the enterprise, and investors reasonably expect to derive profit from those efforts, then this prong of the test is met.  Relevant to this inquiry is the “economic reality”12 of the transaction and “what character the instrument is given in commerce by the terms of the offer, the plan of distribution, and the economic inducements held out to the prospect.”13  The inquiry, therefore, is an objective one, focused on the transaction itself and the manner in which the digital asset is offered and sold.    The following characteristics are especially relevant in an analysis of whether the third prong of the Howey test is satisfied. 1. Reliance on the Efforts of Others The inquiry into whether a purchaser is relying on the efforts of others focuses on two key issues:   Does the purchaser reasonably expect to rely on the efforts of an AP? Are those efforts “the undeniably significant ones, those essential managerial efforts which affect the failure or success of the enterprise,”14 as opposed to efforts that are more ministerial in nature? Although no one of the following characteristics is necessarily determinative, the stronger their presence, the more likely it is that a purchaser of a digital asset is relying on the “efforts of others”: An AP is responsible for the development, improvement (or enhancement), operation, or promotion of the network,15 particularly if purchasers of the digital asset expect an AP to be performing or overseeing tasks that are necessary for the network or digital asset to achieve or retain its intended purpose or functionality.16 o Where the network or the digital asset is still in development and the network or digital asset is not fully functional at the time of the offer or sale, purchasers would reasonably expect an AP to further develop the functionality of the network or digital asset (directly or indirectly).  This particularly would be the case where an AP promises further developmental efforts in order for the digital asset to attain or grow in value.     There are essential tasks or responsibilities performed and expected to be performed by an AP, rather than an unaffiliated, dispersed community of network users (commonly known as a “decentralized” network). An AP creates or supports a market for,17 or the price of, the digital asset.  This can include, for example, an AP that:  (1) controls the creation and issuance of the digital asset; or (2) takes other actions to support a market price of the digital asset, such as by limiting supply or ensuring scarcity, through, for example, buybacks, “burning,” or other activities. An AP has a lead or central role in the direction of the ongoing development of the network or the digital asset.  In particular, an AP plays a lead or central role in deciding governance issues, code updates, or how third parties participate in the validation of transactions that occur with respect to the digital asset. An AP has a continuing managerial role in making decisions about or exercising judgment concerning the network or the characteristics or rights the digital asset represents including, for example: o Determining whether and how to compensate persons providing services to the network or to the entity or entities charged with oversight of the network. o Determining whether and where the digital asset will trade.  For example, purchasers may reasonably rely on an AP for liquidity, such as where the AP has arranged, or promised to arrange for, the trading of the digital asset on a secondary market or platform. o Determining who will receive additional digital assets and under what conditions. o Making or contributing to managerial level business decisions, such as how to deploy funds raised from sales of the digital asset. o Playing a leading role in the validation or confirmation of transactions on the network, or in some other way having responsibility for the ongoing security of the network.   o Making other managerial judgements or decisions that will directly or indirectly impact the success of the network or the value of the digital asset generally.  Purchasers would reasonably expect the AP to undertake efforts to promote its own interests and enhance the value of the network or digital asset, such as where: o The AP has the ability to realize capital appreciation from the value of the digital asset.  This can be demonstrated, for example, if the AP retains a stake or interest in the digital asset.  In these instances, purchasers would reasonably expect the AP to undertake efforts to promote its own interests and enhance the value of the network or digital asset. o The AP distributes the digital asset as compensation to management or the AP’s compensation is tied to the price of the digital asset in the secondary market.  To the extent these facts are present, the compensated individuals can be expected to take steps to build the value of the digital asset. o The AP owns or controls ownership of intellectual property rights of the network or digital asset, directly or indirectly. o The AP monetizes the value of the digital asset, especially where the digital asset has limited functionality. In evaluating whether a digital asset previously sold as a security should be reevaluated at the time of later offers or sales, there would be additional considerations as they relate to the “efforts of others,” including but not limited to: Whether or not the efforts of an AP, including any successor AP, continue to be important to the value of an investment in the digital asset. Whether the network on which the digital asset is to function operates in such a manner that purchasers would no longer reasonably expect an AP to carry out essential managerial or entrepreneurial efforts. Whether the efforts of an AP are no longer affecting the enterprise’s success.

How would a digital asset that had been deemed a security be reevaluated?","In evaluating whether a digital asset previously sold as a security should be reevaluated at the time of later offers or sales, additional considerations relating to the ""efforts of others"" include:
*   Whether the efforts of an Active Participant (AP), including any successor AP, continue to be important to the value of an investment in the digital asset (C. Reasonable Expectation of Profits Derived from Efforts of Others).
*   Whether the network on which the digital asset is to function operates in such a manner that purchasers would no longer reasonably expect an AP to carry out essential managerial or entrepreneurial efforts (C. Reasonable Expectation of Profits Derived from Efforts of Others).
*   Whether the efforts of an AP are no longer affecting the enterprise’s success (C. Reasonable Expectation of Profits Derived from Efforts of Others).","That's a great question, and the document provides some key insights into how a digital asset, once deemed a security, might be reevaluated for later offers or sales.

Essentially, the reevaluation focuses on whether the ""efforts of others"" prong of the Howey test still applies. This is because digital asset networks can evolve over time, potentially becoming more decentralized and less reliant on a central group's managerial efforts.

Here are the main considerations for reevaluating a digital asset that was previously classified as a security:

1.  **Continued Importance of Active Participant (AP) Efforts:** The primary question is whether the efforts of the original Active Participant (AP), or any successor AP, are still crucial to the value of an investment in that digital asset. If the AP's ongoing involvement is no longer a significant driver of the asset's value, this could suggest a change in its classification.

2.  **Evolving Network Operations and Expectations:** The reevaluation would look at how the digital asset's network functions. Specifically, it assesses whether the network now operates in a way that purchasers would no longer reasonably expect an AP to perform essential managerial or entrepreneurial tasks. This implies a shift towards a more self-sustaining, community-driven, or decentralized operational model.

3.  **Impact of AP Efforts on Enterprise Success:** It's important to determine if the AP's efforts are still directly impacting the success of the enterprise or the digital asset. If the enterprise's success is no longer tied to the ongoing managerial efforts of an AP, it weakens the argument for it being a security under the Howey test.

**Why this matters:**

A digital asset might initially be offered and sold as a security because, at that early stage, an identifiable Active Participant (e.g., the development team, a company) is making promises about future development, creating a market, or otherwise playing a central, managerial role that investors rely on for profit.

However, over time, a project might mature and become genuinely decentralized, with governance and development distributed among a broad, unaffiliated community of users. In such a scenario, the ""efforts of others"" component might diminish significantly, leading to a potential reevaluation of whether the digital asset still meets the definition of an investment contract (and thus a security) for subsequent sales.

It's a dynamic assessment, recognizing that the ""economic reality"" of a digital asset and its underlying network can change over time."

Prey selection among Los Angeles car thieves
P Jeffrey Brantingham
Abstract
More than 63,000 cars were reported stolen in Los Angeles in 2003–04. However, the distribution of thefts across
car types is very uneven. Some cars types such as the Honda Civic were stolen at much higher frequencies than
the majority of car types. Charnov’s classic prey selection model suggests that such uneven targeting should be
related to variations in the environmental abundance, expected payoffs, and handling costs associated with
different car types. Street-based surveys in Los Angeles suggest that differences in abundance explain the majority
of thefts. Cars stolen despite being rare may reflect offender preference based on differential payoffs, probably in
some non-monetary currency such as prestige or excitement. Differential handling costs play a more ambiguous
role in target selection, but may underlie thieves’ decisions to ignore some cars common in the environment. The
unspecialized nature of car theft in Los Angeles suggests that the behavioral and cognitive capacities needed to be
a successful car thief are generic. The evolved capacity to solve foraging problems in boundedly-rational ways,
mixed with small amounts of trial-and-error and/or social learning, are sufficient to produce experts from
inexperienced thieves.
Keywords: Crime; Environmental criminology; Behavioral ecology; Optimal foraging; Bounded-rationality;
Social learning
Background
The rational choice theory of crime holds that offenders
engage in crime because they stand to receive significant
short-term benefits with little attendant risk and small
associated costs (Cornish and Clarke 1986, 1987). Presented with a suitable target or victim, unguarded by an
effective security measure, the reasoning offender generally capitalizes on that opportunity (Felson and Clarke
1998; Freeman 1996). Beyond implying a common-sense
relationship between benefits and costs, however, rational choice theory does not immediately identify what
makes any given victim or target suitable. A conceptual
framework introduced by Clarke (1999) suggests that
property targets are suitable when they are concealable,
removable, available, valuable, enjoyable and disposable,
capturing several of the dimensions of costs and benefits
that are important in offender decision making. While
useful, the so-called CRAVED approach also leaves much
unspecified about the relative importance of relationships
among the different dimensions of target suitability.
Here I turn to theory arising outside of criminology to
provide a formal framework in which understand the relationships between target characteristics and offender
target selection. Specifically, I use Charnov’s (1976) prey
selection model to evaluate offender choice to steal different car types. The prey selection model postulates
that a forager will ignore a particular prey type upon encounter if the expected return from a future prey encounter is greater. Preference in Charnov’s model is
defined in terms of the relative abundance of different
prey types and their respective handling costs and payoffs upon consumption. Intuitively, prey that are easy to
handle or have high payoffs may be preferred but rarely
taken, if they are rarely encountered. Prey that are hard
to handle or have low payoffs may still be taken, if more
profitable prey are rarely encountered. Here the predictions of Charnov’s prey selection model are rejected
based on findings that unique car types are stolen almost
exclusively in response to their environmental availability. Only occasionally are cars targeted because they
have higher perceived payoffs. Overall, Los Angeles car
thieves operate primarily as unspecialized foragers.

Optimal foraging theory and crime
Foraging theory is the branch of ecology that seeks to
understand how animal behavior facilitates the encounter, acquisition and processing of resources necessary to
survival (Stephens and Krebs 1986). The foraging challenges facing an animal are substantial. Essential resources are rarely located in the same location as the
animal needing them, necessitating behaviors that either
carry the animal to the resources, or position the animal
to intercept resources that move. Many resource types
possess defenses that aim to thwart acquisition, even
after a forager has encountered them. Animals therefore
need behavioral strategies designed discriminate among
resource types and defeat their defenses once they have
decided to acquire them. Finally, even after a resource as
been encountered and acquired, it may contain a mixture of useable and unusable constituents. Behaviors
may play a key role in sorting and separating these constituents. Only after jumping these foraging hurdles may
an animal benefit from the resource. Recognize, however, that the behaviors deployed to facilitate encounter,
acquisition and processing of a resources are not cost
free. Optimal foraging theory therefore posits that evolution and/or learning has shaped animal behavior to
maximize the average or long-term return rate from essential resources, net the costs of encounter, acquisition
and processing. Here I cast car theft as a foraging problem and test the proposition that the specific car types
stolen represent behaviors consistent with optimal foraging theory.
Three conditions must be met to consider car theft as
an optimal foraging problem (see also Bernasco 2009;
Felson 2006; Johnson et al. 2009). First, car theft should
satisfy a need that is perceived by the offender to be
essential. Car thieves report a range of motivations for
stealing cars including financial motives such as theftfor-export or an immediate need for cash, mundane or
routine motives such as transportation, and recreational
motives such as a search for excitement, prestige or status (Copes 2003; Dhami 2008; Kellett and Gross 2006;
Lantsman 2013; Light et al. 1993). With the exception of
theft-for-transport, car theft is not remarkable in motivation compared with other crimes (Wright et al. 2006;
Wright and Decker 1994). However, car theft may be a
comparably low risk alternative to satisfy these needs
(Copes and Tewksbury 2011). Between 2003 and 2006,
~12.9% of reported car thefts in the US were cleared by
arrests, while robberies over the same period were
cleared at a rate twice as high ~25.8% (Federal Bureau of
Investigation 2003–2006). The vast majority of car thefts
therefore entail no negative consequences, at least over
the short term (Freeman 1999). The benefits may therefore be substantial. Payoffs to car theft might be calculated in a cash currency, if cars and/or their parts are
being fenced (Clarke 1999; Tremblay et al. 2001). Payoffs
might also be calculated in non-cash commodities such
as barter value in drugs (Stevenson and Forsythe 1998)
or prestige and excitement—an essential resource for joy
riding teenagers (Copes 2003; Jacobs et al. 2003; Kellett
and Gross 2006).
Second, car thieves must also have behavioral alternatives to deploy during foraging and these alternatives
must result in different payoff outcomes. Ethnographic
evidence indicates that car theft involves choices between alternative search strategies, tools and techniques for gaining entry and ‘hot wiring’ targeted
vehicles, and strategies for escape and disposal of
stolen vehicles (Copes and Cherbonneau 2006; Copes
and Tewksbury 2011; Farrell et al. 2011; Langworthy
and Lebeau 1992; Lantsman 2013; Light et al. 1993; Lu
2003). Whether these different behavioral alternatives
lead to real differences in payoffs is an open question.
The observation that different car types are stolen to
satisfy different needs may imply differential payoffs
(Clarke 1999). However, the extent to which alternative
behavioral strategies drive these payoffs, as required by
optimal foraging theory, is unknown.
Finally, there must be a mechanism by which car
thieves select among the alternative behaviors, yielding
near-optimal strategies for locating, stealing and disposing of cars. Simple trial-and-error and/or social
learning in the context of co-offending appear to play
this role (Akers 2008; Reiss and Farrington 1991). Juvenile car thieves often start as passengers, observing
the actions of their more experienced friends (Light
et al. 1993). Such learning mechanisms seem capable
quickly producing effective cognitive scripts that car
thieves can adhere to during commission of a crime
(Tremblay et al. 2001).
The prey selection model
The foraging problem confronted by car thieves is
similar in many ways to prey selection, a classical
problem in behavioral ecology studied by Charnov
(1976) and others (see Krebs et al. 1977; Stephens
and Krebs 1986). Given sequential encounters with
prey types, each having different expected returns
and handling costs, which types should be pursued
and captured? Let ei, hi and λi be the expected payoff,
handling cost and local density of a prey of type i.
Prey types i = 1, 2, … N are ranked in descending
order of the ratio of payoff to handling cost ei/hi. The
prey classification algorithm says that prey types i =
1, 2, … j should be pursued and captured upon encounter, but prey type j + 1 should be ignored if its
payoff to handling cost ratio is below the mean for
all higher ranked prey:

In other words, if the expected return from future prey
encounters is higher than would be gained by taking the
current target, then it is better to wait.
The prey choice model makes two distinctive predictions. First, prey types are either always taken upon
encounter, or always ignored. This is the so-called
“zero–one” rule in reference to the analytical result that
an attack on prey type i will occur with probability
qi = 0, or qi = 1, and nothing in between (Stephens and
Krebs 1986). Second, whether or not a prey type is taken
is dependent only on the encounter rate with higherranked prey, not its own encounter rate. Note that the
term λi appears only on the left-hand side in Equation
(1). The implication is that only changes in the encounter rate with higher ranked prey items will impact the
decision to attack a lower ranked prey item once it has
been encountered. Thus, if a higher ranked prey type becomes very scarce, a lower ranked prey type may be
added to the diet. However, if a lower ranked prey type
suddenly becomes very common, it will not necessarily
be added to the diet without a concomitant change in
the rate of encounter with higher ranked types. Empirical evidence from both animal (Hughes and Dunkin
1984; Prugh 2005; but see Pyke 1984) and human foragers (Hames and Vickers 1982; Smith 1991) suggests
that the prey classification algorithm provides insights
into prey selection behavior across a diverse range of
taxa and foraging contexts.
Car theft may be considered a special case of prey selection if car types vary in expected payoffs, handling
costs and/or local abundance and offenders are attentive
to these differences. As discussed in the Methods section, the available data on payoffs and handling times do
not allow for a fine-grained test of either the zero–one
rule, or the hypothesis that changes in the encounter
rate with higher-ranked car types impact the inclusion of
lower ranked car types in an offender’s ‘diet’. A strict
reading of the prey choice model also suggests that car
theft may not perfectly conform to all of its assumptions
(see for comparison Smith 1991). The prey choice model
assumes that: (1) foragers are long-term rate maximizers, meaning that average results of stealing cars over
long time periods, rather than short-term gains, are optimized by different foraging strategies; (2) searching for
and handling of targeted vehicles are mutually exclusive;
(3) encounters with vehicles follow a Poisson process,
meaning that two cars cannot be encountered simultaneously and each encounter is statistically independent of
all others; (4) the payoff to stealing cars ei, the handling
costs hi, and encounter rates λi are environmentally fixed
in time and space; and (5) that the foraging car thief has
perfect information about ei, hi and λi.
Assumptions 1, 2, 3 and 5 may be reasonable for car
theft. The notion that criminal behavioral strategies
might be shaped by learning to produce long-term average rate maximization (Assumption 1) seems far fetched
at first (but see Tremblay and Morselli 2000). Criminal
offenders tend to be present-oriented (Gottfredson and
Hirschi 1990; Nagin and Paternoster 1994) and therefore
appear little concerned with the long-term costs and
benefits of crime (Wilson and Abrahamse 1992). However, the question at hand is not whether crime pays
relative to non-crime alternatives, but rather whether
stealing one car type is more profitable in the long run
than stealing an alternative car type. It is conceivable
that offenders adopt strategies that maximize the longterm or average payoffs from car theft by making discriminating choices about which cars to steal.
It is also reasonable to suppose that simultaneous
search for cars to steal and the physical act stealing a car
are mutually exclusive activities (Assumption 2). This is
made more complicated by co-offending, which is quite
common for younger car thieves (Light et al. 1993), if
some in an offending party search nearby targets while
others are breaking into a given car.
It is unknown whether encounters with cars to steal
follow a Poisson process (Assumption 3). Ultimately, this
is an empirical question for which data need to be
collected. Conceptually, however, a motivated car thief
walking down a linear street segment encounters cars
sequentially and independently. Whether such conditions hold in a parking lot may depend on situational
factors such as the layout of and available observation
points in the lot. The prey choice model is not obviated
under these circumstances (Stephens and Krebs 1986:
38–45), but additional costs associated with discriminating between simultaneously encountered car types must
be taken into account.
Perhaps the greatest challenge comes from strictly assuming that the key parameters of prey selection remain
fixed in time and space (Assumption 4) (Suresh and
Tewksbury 2013). At intermediate time scales (months
to years), the payoffs to stealing different car types certainly change with turnover in the composition of cars
on the street. Early and late model years may differ significantly in both perceived or actual value as well as
handling costs, for example, following the introduction
of RFID keys for ignition systems (Farrell et al. 2011).
Similarly, there may be short-term (hourly-daily) fluctuations in environmental abundance of cars parked in locations where they might be stolen. Nevertheless, it is
reasonable to assume that car thieves have relatively
Brantingham Crime Science 2013, 2:3 Page 3 of 11
http://www.crimesciencejournal.com/content/2/1/3
accurate knowledge of the encounter rates, payoffs and
handling costs associated with different cars, or learn them
very quickly when conditions change (Assumption 5)
(Akers 2008; Light et al. 1993).
Given the above limitations, I test a conservative null
hypothesis in place of the two detailed predictions made
by the prey selection model:
 H0. If every car yields the same payoff and all are
equally difficult to steal (i. e., ei/hi = ej/hj ∀ i, j),
then differences in theft rates arise only from
differences in relative abundances of car types λi.
In other words, if all cars rank equally in the ratio of
payoffs to handling costs, then all cars are part of the
‘diet’ and should be taken immediately upon encounter.
Cars encountered more frequently will appear in the diet
more often and, in fact, will be stolen at a frequency
proportional to λi. One should therefore expect a strong
correlation between relative abundances and theft rates
if the null hypothesis is true. Failure to reject the null
hypothesis implies that car thieves are unspecialized foragers and take only what is presented to them by the environment. Rejection of the null hypothesis, for all or
even some car types, may constitute evidence that differential payoffs and/or handling costs enter into car
thieves’ situational foraging decisions. Under these circumstances we can evaluate the role that payoffs and/or
handling costs may play in driving target choice.
Methods
Car types are defined as unique make-models or, where
necessary, make-model-years. For example, 1992 and
2002 Honda Civics may be different car types, from the
point of view of the offender, because they have different
perceived payoffs and may also differ in how easy they
are to break into and ‘hot wire’ (Farrell et al. 2011). An
initial database of car make-model-years was assembled
using a popular car shopping and research website,
www.edmonds.com. A student assistant was then trained
to quickly and accurately identify car types in pilot surveys of a university campus parking structures.
Street-based surveys were conducted in three Los
Angeles zip codes (90034, 90045 and 90291) during two
excursions in October-December 2004 and OctoberDecember 2005. The three survey locations had the
highest volume of car thefts in 2003 among zip codes on
the Los Angeles West Side. Surveys involved walking between one and three contiguous blocks, first up one side
and then down the other. Surveys on the exact same
block segments were conducted at two-hour intervals
between 6AM and 6PM. The most dramatic change in
density of cars parked on the street occurred between
6AM and 8AM. I therefore assume that the mix of car
types seen at 6AM represents the overnight diversity.
Only vehicles in publically accessible street locations
were recorded. The observed relative frequency of each
car type i is used as a measure of encounter rate λi.
Expected value on the illegal market is used as a proxy
for the payoffs ei associated with stealing different car
types (Copes 2003; Matsueda et al. 1992). I do not assume that all car thieves seek cash. Rather, illegal market
value is a generic currency that is expected to be positively correlated with non-monetary payoffs. For example, a ‘hot car’ is not only more likely to demand
more money in an illegal market context, but it is also
expected to have a higher payoff in excitement and prestige for the teenage car thief. Illegal market value is calculated as ei = f ∑ ipivi, where pi is the proportion of cars
of a given make-model-year stolen, vi is the legal market
value of the car at the time of theft as determined from
the Kelley Blue Book (DeBacker 2003), and f is the fraction of the legal market value realized on the illegal market. I assume that f = 0.1, but choice of a different
constant does not impact the results.
I use break-in times as a proxy for overall handling
costs hi. The UK-based “What Car?” Security Supertest
(Secured by Design 2000, 2003) conducted attack testing
of new cars marketed in the UK. The tests evaluated the
ability of new vehicles to withstand attacks by trained
locksmiths using the non-destructive entry techniques
commonly deployed by car thieves. The tests included
123 unique make-models and measured the time, in
seconds, needed to gain entry to each vehicle. A car
was considered to pass the test if it was not possible
to gain entry within two minutes. Break-in time represents only one of the handling costs associated with
car theft. I assume, however, that the handling costs
at different critical points in the theft process are
positively correlated. For example, if a car is easy to
enter, it is also more likely to be easy to ‘hot wire’,
less likely to have a geo-location device installed and
be easier to chop.
Evaluation of the relationships between car theft, environmental abundances, payoffs and handling costs is conducted
using non-parametric statistics that are robust to ordinal
scale data and non-normal distribution characteristics
(Conover 1998). Theft frequencies and environmental abundances are compared using Kendall’s τ, a generalized correlation coefficient that measures the similarity of ranked
order lists. Kendall’s τ b allows for rank order ties. Illegal
market values and break-in times among common and
rare cares are non-normally distributed. Medians
therefore provide the most robust measure of central
tendency and the non-parametric Mann–Whitney U
the most appropriate corresponding statistical test.
Differences in distribution shape are computed using
the non-parametric Kolmogorov-Smirnov D.

Results
Between 1 Jan 2003 and 31 December 2004, 63,528 vehicles were reported stolen within the City of Los Angeles
(Federal Bureau of Investigation 2003–2006). In zip
codes 90034, 90045 and 90291, located on the West Side
of Los Angeles and representing ~3.5% of the land area
of the City, a total of 2,251 cars were stolen during the
same period, or ~3.5% of all thefts. These cars are divided into 271 unique make-model types. The Honda
Civic and Accord, Toyota Camry and Corolla, and
Nissan Sentra together comprise ~25% of the total
thefts and 87 car types are represented by single thefts
(Figure 1A, Table 1).
To test whether the observed bias in thefts towards
some car types is driven by environmental abundance, I
conducted surveys of main artery and residential streets
(see Methods). A total of 1,825 cars were observed and
these were classified into 262 unique make-model types.
As with reported thefts, the cars available on the streets
are dominated by a few types (Figure 1B). Seventy seven types identified in the survey are singletons. The distribution is qualitatively similar to rank species abundance curves in ecology, which show environments
numerically dominated by a few species, but most of
the richness is accumulated through species with small
numbers of individuals Hubbell (2001). Here I focus on
the top 25 most commonly stolen cars. These car types
account for 53% of the total observed volume of stolen
cars (N = 1198) and the bulk of the variation in theft
frequency.
A comparison of theft and density rank order frequencies shows a significant positive relationship (Kendall’s τ
b = 0.491, p < 0.001) (Figure 2). Thirteen of the top 25
most stolen cars are also in the top 25 for abundance
(Table 1). In general, the most common cars on the
street are also the most stolen. The positive relationship
between abundance and theft is particularly strong
among the top nine most stolen cars (Kendall’s τ b =
0.611, p = 0.022). Honda Civics are the most abundant
cars and the most frequently stolen. For the top nine
cars it is difficult to reject the null hypothesis that environmental abundance is driving the targeting of these vehicles for theft.
Note, however, that approximately one half (N = 12)
of the top 25 most stolen cars are not in the top 25
for abundance. Several of these are significant outliers
(Table 1). For example, the Chrysler 300M is ranked
14, with 33 thefts in 2003–04, but was observed only

once in the 1,825 cars identified in street surveys (survey rank = 224). Similarly, the Pontiac Grand AM was
ranked 10, with 44 thefts, but was observed only four
times in the same surveys (survey rank = 110.5). It
may be that thieves targeted these rare cars based on
specialized evaluation of the expected payoffs, handling
costs, or both, made at the time of encounter.
Taking into account car make, model and year, I calculated the expected illegal market value for each car
stolen in 2003 as 10% of the Kelley Blue Book value
at the time of theft (see Methods) (DeBacker 2003;
Stevenson and Forsythe 1998; Tremblay et al. 2001).
Illegal market value is used as broad proxy for both
monetary and non-monetary payoffs. Figure 3 shows
that the distribution of expected illegal market values
for the outliers is significantly different from that associated with environmentally common cars (Mann–Whitney
U = 8562, Wilcoxon = 73542, Z = −11.327, p < .001).
Among the environmentally common cars, the median
expected illegal market value is $740 (min = $293, max =
$2,916). Among the environmentally rare cars, the median
is twice as large at $1,515 (min = $210, max $4,493).
These data suggest that the outliers within the sample of
stolen cars may be targeted because they offer a higher
expected payoff.
It is also possible that ease-of-theft is responsible
for the observed outliers (Farrell et al. 2011; Light
et al. 1993; Wiles and Costello 2000). The UK-based
“WhatCar?” Security Supertest (Secured by Design
2000, 2003), evaluated the ability of a range of new
vehicles to withstand attacks using non-destructive
entry techniques (see Methods). Break-in time is used
as a proxy for handling costs at all stages of the theft
process. The aggregated results from 2000 and 2003, excluding those cars that passed the test, show a weak, but
significant relationship between break-in times and

Figure 2 A scatter plot of abundance rank order against theft rank order shows a strong positive relationship between car availability

using the UK data. However, some indication of handling
costs may be gained by examining patterns within manufactures. Seven of the cars stolen in disproportion
to their environmental density were manufactured by
Daimler-Chrysler, three by Ford and two by GM (Table 1).
Of the 123 cars tested in the Security Supertests, 44 were
vehicles by these manufacturers. Eleven (25%) successfully
withstood attacks lasting two minutes, compared with 24
of the remaining 79 car types (44%). The data may suggest that Daimler-Chrysler, GM and Ford vehicles are
more broadly susceptible to attack. However, a range of
break-in times characterize the vehicles that did not
pass the test (Table 2). Low and high-mid market cars
sold under the Chrysler brand (e.g., Neon, Grand Voyager)
have minimum break-in times of between four and six
seconds, while one low-market GM car sold under the
Vauxhall brand had a brake-in time of two seconds. Midmarket GM cars, also sold under the Vauxhall brand, had
a mean break-in time of 81 seconds. The aggregate
results do not indicate that cars made by DaimlerChrysler, Ford or GM are disproportionately easier
for car thieves to handle. Indeed, cars marketed by
other manufacturers show a significant skew towards
shorter break-in times and, by implication, lower handling costs for thieves (Kolmogorov-Smirnov Z = 1.349,
p = 0.053) (Figure 4B,C).
Discussion and conclusion
It is difficult to reject the null hypothesis that environmental abundance is the primary determinant of what
cars are targeted for theft. There is a particularly strong
relationship between abundance and theft rank for the
top-nine most stolen cars. In the CRAVED conceptual
framework put forward by Clarke (1999), availability
would seem to outweigh other dimensions that might
influence theft choice. In the instances where cars are
targeted despite being rare, payoff differences may play
some role. Car recovery rates provide one measure of
the importance of non-monetary, or possibly limited
monetary payoffs to car theft (Clarke and Harris 1992).
There is little systematic difference in the rate of recovery across car types (Table 1), suggesting that none of
the top 25 most stolen cars are disproportionately landing in fully-body chop shops or being stolen for export.
The payoffs here seem to be primarily non-monetary.
Furthermore, among the outliers that are stolen despite
being rare, it appears that the newest model years are
targeted. For example, eight of 12 Chrysler 300s and
seven of 13 Chrysler Sebrings stolen during 2003 were
2004 model years, which became available only in the
last five months of the year. The implication is that these
cars, though rare, were targeted precisely because they
were perceived to be ‘hot rides’ (Wiles and Costello
2000). That some cars are more valuable or enjoyable
can override their low availability, but this occurs
infrequently.
It is less apparent that lower handling costs biased
thieves’ decisions to target environmentally rare cars, although ethnographic work suggests that handling costs
are often a significant concern (Clarke 1999; Light et al.
1993; Wiles and Costello 2000). Recent research suggests that the potential for encountering opposition from
car owners is a major concern (Copes and Tewksbury
2011), but it is uncertain how the probability of opposition might relate to car type. Direct handling costs may
have played a role in driving Los Angeles car thieves to

ignore certain environmentally common cars. Seven
make-model types including the Volkswagen Jetta, Toyota
RAV4 and Nissan Xterra ranked within the top 25 for
abundance, but were rarely or never stolen (Table 3). An
average of 57% of the vehicles sold by the corresponding
manufactures in the UK passed the Security Supertests.
This is compared only 25% of Daimler-Chrysler, GM and
Ford cars representative of the environmentally rare
group. The implication is that these cars may be ignored
because they are more resistant to attack. Detailed attack
analyses of cars from the US market could help resolve
the exact role of handling costs in the differential targeting
of some cars.
In spite of the narrow role that differential payoffs and
handling costs appear to play the choice of which cars to
steal, one must be careful to not fall prey to the ecological fallacy. Ethnographic evidence points to a degree
of specialization among car thieves, with distinctions
among those engaged in opportunistic theft and those in
organized crime, and among younger and older offenders. Such specializations are not directly visible in
aggregate car theft data. It is possible that the population
of Los Angeles car thieves consists of several different
types each with their preferred prey. The observed frequency of stolen car types might therefore represent a
mixture of fixed, independent strategies, some rare and

some common, not variation in the behavior of offenders in general. The converse is also potentially true.
There is a danger of falling prey to an ethnographic fallacy that confounds our ability to infer aggregate characteristics from ethnographically rich data collected at an
individual scale. To wit, given interviews with tens of car
thieves about their offending preferences, can we reliably
infer the population characteristics of the many thousands of individuals likely responsible for the 63,000 cars
stolen in Los Angeles in 2003-2004? There is no easy
way to resolve the ecological or ethnographic fallacy. I
suspect, however, that the unspecialized foragers responding primarily to environmental abundances greatly outnumber the specialists, making the latter practically
invisible in aggregate data.
The results described here are important for understanding the broader causes of criminal behavior and
may suggest novel approaches to crime prevention based
on formal ecological models (see also Bernasco 2009;
Brantingham et al. 2012; Felson 2006). The unspecialized
nature of car theft in Los Angeles implies that the behavioral and cognitive capacities needed to be a successful thief are generic. Indeed, humans are well-equipped
to become effective foragers for criminal opportunities
given an evolved psychology to solve foraging problems
in boundedly-rational ways (Hutchinson et al. 2007),
combined with small amounts of individual trial-and-error
or social learning (Akers 2008; Boyd and Richerson 1985).
Indeed, the co-offending that characterizes the early careers (<20 years old) of most offenders, including car
thieves, is ideally suited to the transmission of the simple
skills sufficient to produce experts from inexperienced
thieves (Reiss and Farrington 1991). That auto theft in Los
Angeles is driven primarily by environmental structure
provides further evidence that the greatest gains in crime
prevention are to be had in altering the structure of criminal opportunity (Brantingham and Brantingham 1981;
Farrell et al. 2011; Felson and Clarke 1998). How environmental alterations impact situational foraging behaviors
and longer-term population trajectories are well-studied
within ecology (Henle et al. 2004; Kerr et al. 2007),
suggesting a way forward for formal crime ecology.

What is optimal foraging theory when compared to automotive theft?","Optimal foraging theory is a branch of ecology that examines how animal behavior maximizes the average or long-term return rate from essential resources, accounting for the costs associated with encountering, acquiring, and processing these resources (Stephens and Krebs 1986).

Automotive theft is cast as a foraging problem, with the specific car types stolen representing behaviors consistent with optimal foraging theory (Brantingham). For car theft to be considered an optimal foraging problem, three conditions must be met:
1.  Car theft must fulfill a need that the offender perceives as essential, such as financial gain, transportation, or recreational motives like excitement or prestige (Copes 2003; Dhami 2008; Kellett and Gross 2006; Lantsman 2013; Light et al. 1993).
2.  Car thieves must have behavioral alternatives during foraging that lead to different payoff outcomes. These alternatives include choices in search strategies, tools and techniques for gaining entry and 'hot wiring' vehicles, and strategies for escape and disposal of stolen vehicles (Copes and Cherbonneau 2006; Copes and Tewksbury 2011; Farrell et al. 2011; Langworthy and Lebeau 1992; Lantsman 2013; Light et al. 1993; Lu 2003).
3.  There must be a mechanism, such as simple trial-and-error or social learning, for car thieves to select among these alternative behaviors, resulting in near-optimal strategies for locating, stealing, and disposing of cars (Akers 2008; Reiss and Farrington 1991).

The foraging problem faced by car thieves is considered similar to prey selection, where car types vary in expected payoffs, handling costs, and local abundance, and offenders are responsive to these differences (Charnov 1976; Stephens and Krebs 1986).","That's a fascinating question, and the document you've provided gives a great framework for understanding it!

Essentially, **Optimal Foraging Theory (OFT)** is a concept borrowed from ecology that helps us understand how animals make decisions about finding and consuming resources to maximize their energy intake while minimizing costs. When applied to automotive theft, the document suggests that car thieves, like foragers in the wild, make ""prey selection"" decisions based on similar principles.

Let's break down how Optimal Foraging Theory compares to automotive theft:

### What is Optimal Foraging Theory (OFT)?

In the natural world, animals (foragers) need to find food (prey) to survive. OFT proposes that evolution and/or learning have shaped animal behavior to be ""optimal"" in this process. This means they try to maximize the average or long-term return rate from essential resources, while accounting for the ""costs"" involved.

Key elements in OFT include:

*   **Prey Types:** Different kinds of food available (e.g., big juicy insects vs. small, hard-to-catch ones).
*   **Expected Payoff ($e_i$):** The energy or nutritional value gained from consuming a particular prey type.
*   **Handling Costs ($h_i$):** The time and energy spent acquiring and processing the prey (e.g., chasing, catching, breaking open a shell, digesting).
*   **Local Density/Abundance ($\lambda_i$):** How frequently a particular prey type is encountered in the environment.
*   **Decision Rule:** Foragers decide whether to pursue a prey item based on its potential payoff relative to the handling cost, and in comparison to the expected return from *future* encounters with even better prey.

### How it Compares to Automotive Theft (The ""Foraging Problem"" of Car Thieves)

The document brilliantly casts car theft as a ""foraging problem"" where the ""prey"" are different car types. Here’s how the OFT elements translate:

1.  **The ""Need"" or Motivation:** Just as animals forage for survival, car thieves engage in theft to satisfy perceived ""essential needs."" These can be:
    *   **Financial:** Stealing cars for export, parts (chop shops), or immediate cash (e.g., selling for drugs).
    *   **Mundane/Routine:** Simply needing transportation.
    *   **Recreational/Social:** Seeking excitement, prestige, or status (especially for joyriding teenagers).
    *   Car theft is often seen as a relatively low-risk way to satisfy these needs compared to other crimes.

2.  **Behavioral Alternatives and Payoffs:** Thieves aren't just randomly picking cars. They have choices in their ""foraging strategies,"" such as:
    *   **Search strategies:** Where and how they look for cars.
    *   **Tools and techniques:** Methods for gaining entry and ""hot-wiring"" vehicles.
    *   **Disposal strategies:** How they get rid of the stolen car (e.g., selling, stripping for parts, abandoning).
    *   These different choices are expected to lead to varying ""payoffs"" (monetary value, excitement, ease of disposal) and ""costs"" (risk of getting caught, effort involved).

3.  **Selection Mechanism (Learning):** Thieves learn over time which strategies are most effective. This happens through:
    *   **Trial-and-error:** Figuring out what works best on their own.
    *   **Social learning:** Observing more experienced co-offenders, especially common among younger thieves. This rapid learning helps them develop ""cognitive scripts"" for successful theft.

### Applying Key OFT Concepts to Car Theft:

*   **Prey Types:** Instead of different animal species, car thieves encounter various **car types** (e.g., 1992 Honda Civic vs. 2004 Chrysler 300M).
*   **Expected Payoff ($e_i$):** This isn't just about cash! It's a broad ""currency"" that includes:
    *   **Monetary value:** What the car or its parts can fetch on the illegal market.
    *   **Non-monetary value:** Prestige, excitement, status, or even barter value (e.g., for drugs). The study used illegal market value as a proxy, assuming it correlates with non-monetary payoffs.
*   **Handling Costs ($h_i$):** The effort and risk associated with stealing a particular car:
    *   **Ease of entry/hot-wiring:** How long it takes to break in (measured by ""break-in times"" in security tests).
    *   **Security features:** Advanced ignition systems, tracking devices.
    *   **Risk of capture:** Probability of encountering owners or police.
    *   **Disposal difficulty:** How easy it is to sell, strip, or ditch the car.
*   **Local Density/Abundance ($\lambda_i$):** This refers to the **environmental abundance** of specific car types on the streets of Los Angeles. How many Honda Civics are typically parked in a given area?

### What the Study Found:

The study tested a ""null hypothesis"" that if all cars offered the same payoff-to-handling-cost ratio, then differences in theft rates would *only* come from differences in their environmental abundance.

The results showed that for Los Angeles car thieves:

*   **Abundance is Key:** Environmental abundance was the **primary determinant** of which cars were stolen. The most common cars on the street were also the most frequently stolen (e.g., Honda Civic). This suggests that many car thieves act as **unspecialized foragers**, taking what's most readily available.
*   **Payoffs for Outliers:** For cars that were stolen *despite being rare* (outliers), higher **expected payoffs** seemed to play a role. These cars might be perceived as ""hot rides"" offering more excitement or prestige, or perhaps higher monetary value, overriding their low availability.
*   **Handling Costs' Ambiguous Role:** While handling costs (like ease of break-in) are relevant, the study couldn't definitively conclude they were the primary driver for targeting rare cars. However, handling costs *might* explain why some **environmentally common cars are ignored**—they might be too difficult to steal due to better security.

### Conclusion

By using Optimal Foraging Theory, the research highlights that car theft, at a population level, often mirrors simple ecological foraging strategies. While individual thieves might have specialties, the aggregate data suggests that the majority are ""unspecialized foragers"" who primarily respond to the readily available ""prey"" (cars) in their environment.

This perspective is crucial because it suggests that crime prevention efforts should focus on **altering the structure of criminal opportunity**—making certain car types harder to steal, or reducing their desirability, rather than solely focusing on the motivations of individual offenders."

Objectives: Maternal age has been increasing for several decades with many of these late pregnancies between 40 and 45 years old. The main objective of this study is to assess whether maternal age is an independent factor of obstetric, fetal, and neonatal complications.
 

 Patients and methods: A monocentric, French study “exposed-unexposed” was conducted during 11 years in a maternity level IIB. Maternal and perinatal outcomes were studied using univariates and multivariate analysis. We compared women aged 40 and above in a 1:1 ratio with women of 25–35 years old.
 

 Results: One thousand nine hundred eighty-two women were 40 or older (mean age: 41.9) on the day of their delivery and compared to other 1,982 women who were aged between 25 and 35 years old (mean age: 30.7) Preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, were significantly higher in the study group (4.6 vs. 1.5% and 14.5 vs. 6.9%, respectively, p < 0.001). We found also a significant difference for gestational hypertension (3.1 vs. 1.1% p < 0.001), preterm birth (10.4 vs. 6.5% p < 0.001), cesarean (16.6 vs. 5.4% for scheduled cesarean, and 50.4 vs. 13.9% for emergency cesarean, p < 0.001) and fetal death in utero (2.1 vs. 0.5% in the study group, p < 0.001). These results were also significantly different in multivariate analysis.
 

 Objectives
 The main objective of the study is to determine the incidence of obstetric, fetal, and neonatal complication and to assess whether age is an independent factor of these complications.
 

 The secondary objectives are to determine whether there is an association between some complications (pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, prematurity) and the conception mode associated with the type of pregnancy (singleton or twin).
 

 The obstetrical complications studied are gestational hypertension (defined as systolic >140 mmH and/or diastolic >90 mmHg without proteinuria), pre-eclampsia (systolic >140 mmHand/or diastolic >90 mmHg associated with a proteinuria of 24 h >300 mg), gestational diabetes (defined according to the recommendations of the 2015 CNGOF), cesarean section (CS), admission of women to the intensive care unit during their pregnancies, postpartum hemorrhage (loss of more than 500 cc of blood within 24 h after vaginal delivery or CS) and blood transfusion.
 

 The fetal complications studied are intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) (defined as having an estimation of fetal weight <5e p) and fetal death in utero (FDIU).
 

 The neonatal complications studied were prematurity (birth before 37 weeks), pH at birth (acidosis with pH <7.10), APGAR score (<7), and pediatric care just after the birth.
 

 Discussion
 Our study shows that advanced maternal age is an independent risk factor for obstetric and neonatal complications (14, 15). In fact, multivariate analysis found significant results for three of the most common pregnancy-related diseases: gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia, and gestational diabetes. Our large sample significantly confirms the occurrence of pre-eclampsia in women aged 40 and above, unlike some studies with small samples that did not find this result in multivariate analysis (3).
 

 Moreover, there is a higher risk of pre-eclampsia when the patient has some other risk factor such as twin pregnancy or medical history (hypertension and/or diabetes and/or VTE/vascular disease/lupus) (16, 17). Even more, these women with advanced maternal age are at higher risk of developing cardiovascular and nephrological diseases in the long term (18). In the case of tobacco, it has not been found as an independent risk factor, which can probably be explained by a significant underestimation of women reporting smoking during pregnancy.
 

 The high proportion of cesareans in the study group of women over 40 is due to some contributing factors. On one hand, the percentage of scheduled cesareans is higher because there is a higher prevalence of uni or multi-cicatricial uterus.
 

 Cesareans for high maternal age or for maternal request finally represented a small sample (22 women/1,982, 1% in the exposed group vs. 1/1,982 in the unexposed group). There was also a higher rate about the emergency cesareans deliveries in the study group over 40 years old. Several physiological hypotheses have been mentioned in previous studies (2, 3): a higher rate of dystocia presentation and scarred uterus, uterine contractility less effective than for a woman aged 25–35. In our sample, the most common indications for CS were abnormalities of cardio-fetal rhythm and cervical dystocia (19). It is likely that CFR abnormalities are more severely judged by the obstetrician, in the context of older patients, especially if the pregnancy is a result of ART, putting some women at a risk of cesarean that is not always justified (20). In total, this large proportion of CS in women 40 years and older has also been shown in other studies (3, 4, 17, 20–22). However, these results should be taken with caution because some indications for CS are inherent to the protocols practiced in our unit.
 

 The association between advanced maternal age and fetal deaths in utero should also be taken into account. Among those 43 FDIUs, we have looked at every medical files of those women and we did not find any events that could explained this high number. Indeed, among the 43 FDIUs in women aged 40 and above, there were no more patients using ART, nor more patients with obstetric pathology. This can be explained by a small number of FDIU. The only common point in our study group was the advanced maternal age. In these circumstances, instead of worrying the patients, it might be more appropriate to give them clear and reassuring information while performing a pre-conception close monitoring and throughout the pregnancy. This would help detect and manage these complications much earlier. In addition, with the advanced technology, several risks are now monitored using non-invasive prenatal screening or even the pre-implantation diagnosis (23–26).
 

 The incidence of maternal complications is likely to increase over time due to increased maternal age. It will be difficult to reduce the incidence of these complications, but we can reduce the serious complications of preeclampsia, gestational diabetes (such as eclampsia, and macrosomia) through appropriate management (induce delivery before 41 weeks, close monitoring of the fetus) (27, 28).
 

 With regard to neonatal complications, few significant differences were found in our study, as well as in the literature (29, 30). This is partly explained by the fact that several obstetrical factors can interfere without being related to age (the length of the delivery, abnormalities of the RCF, chorioamnionitis (3, 31, 32).
 

 Our study has several advantages. On the one hand, our study was done on a large sample, with data processing from medical records with a complete search for missing data. International and European studies with large samples use public health registers, thereby providing a lot of information on the characteristics of the population (5, 10). However, this is often at the expense of information such as the type of delivery, the methods of neonatology care which are sometimes different in hospitals.
 

 On the other hand, we took a period of 11 years, to check if there had been a difference in daily practices. We did not notice any difference between the periods 2006–2010 and 2011–2017 except for the increasing number of patients who have access to ART.
 

 On the other hand, we matched each patient aged 40 and above to a patient aged between 25 and 35 whose delivery number followed the patient case. Indeed, this allowed us to limit as far as possible all the variability of practices on the delivery route (natural delivery vs. cesarean, neonatal care). We also had the advantage of separating fetuses, newborns, and mothers, which has not been realized in other studies, and which may lead to a classification bias regarding perinatal outcomes.
 

 Our study is yet limited by its monocentric character and retrospective aspect. In addition, Foch Hospital has an ART center, so our sample probably contained more patients using these techniques. However, we had the opportunity to have 18.2% of women over 40 using ART. This allowed us to highlight the significant increase in preeclampsia and prematurity in patients over 40 years of age who have used ART. After 44 years, 1 out of 2 women used the ART. This rate is surely underestimated because there is a large number of patients who voluntarily omit to declare their use of ART in particular the use of donated oocytes (33).
 

 It is especially remembered that maternal complications occurring decades ago are less morbid today than before (22, 34). Screening and management of maternal and neonatal complications are progressively improving, and a high-risk pregnancy at age 40 in the 1980s should no longer discourage patients and obstetricians in 2020.

USER REQUEST:
Researchers at Foch Hospital in France published this study of pregnancy outcomes in two groups of patients. Please summarize outcomes across the three kinds of complications that the researchers studied.","Researchers at Foch Hospital in France conducted a study comparing pregnancy outcomes in women aged 40 and above (mean age: 41.9) with women aged 25-35 years old (mean age: 30.7) (Results). The outcomes across the three kinds of complications were as follows:

*   **Obstetric Complications:**
    *   Preeclampsia was significantly higher in the study group (4.6% vs. 1.5%, p < 0.001) (Results).
    *   Gestational diabetes was significantly higher in the study group (14.5% vs. 6.9%, p < 0.001) (Results).
    *   Gestational hypertension was significantly higher (3.1% vs. 1.1%, p < 0.001) (Results).
    *   Cesarean rates were significantly higher, including scheduled cesareans (16.6% vs. 5.4%) and emergency cesareans (50.4% vs. 13.9%), both with p < 0.001 (Results).
    *   Advanced maternal age was identified as an independent risk factor for gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia, and gestational diabetes in multivariate analysis (Discussion).

*   **Fetal Complications:**
    *   Fetal death in utero (FDIU) was significantly higher in the study group (2.1% vs. 0.5%, p < 0.001) (Results).

*   **Neonatal Complications:**
    *   Preterm birth was significantly higher (10.4% vs. 6.5%, p < 0.001) (Results).
    *   Overall, few significant differences were found regarding neonatal complications in the study (Discussion).","The researchers at Foch Hospital in France conducted an 11-year study to investigate how maternal age impacts pregnancy outcomes, particularly looking at women aged 40 and above compared to those aged 25-35. They studied a wide range of obstetric, fetal, and neonatal complications. Here's a summary of what they found across these three categories:

### Obstetrical Complications

The study clearly indicated that women aged 40 and older faced a significantly higher risk of several obstetrical complications:

*   **Preeclampsia:** This serious condition, characterized by high blood pressure and protein in the urine, was significantly more common in the older age group (4.6% vs. 1.5% in the younger group).
*   **Gestational Diabetes:** Women over 40 had a much higher incidence of gestational diabetes (14.5% vs. 6.9%).
*   **Gestational Hypertension:** High blood pressure during pregnancy (without proteinuria) was also more prevalent in the older group (3.1% vs. 1.1%).
*   **Cesarean Sections (CS):** There was a remarkably higher rate of C-sections among women aged 40 and above. Both scheduled cesareans (16.6% vs. 5.4%) and emergency cesareans (50.4% vs. 13.9%) were significantly more frequent. The researchers attributed this to factors like a higher prevalence of scarred uteruses (from previous surgeries), less effective uterine contractility, and possibly a more cautious approach by obstetricians, especially if the pregnancy involved assisted reproductive technologies (ART).
*   The study also looked at other complications like postpartum hemorrhage, blood transfusions, and ICU admissions for the mother, and the discussion emphasized that advanced maternal age is an independent risk factor for these types of complications, particularly highlighting gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia, and gestational diabetes.

### Fetal Complications

When it came to complications affecting the fetus, one significant finding stood out:

*   **Fetal Death in Utero (FDIU):** The rate of fetal death in utero was significantly higher in the group of women aged 40 and above (2.1% vs. 0.5%). The researchers specifically investigated these cases and found that advanced maternal age was the only consistent common point, suggesting it's an independent risk factor.
*   Intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) was also studied, but specific comparative results for this complication were not detailed in the provided text.

### Neonatal Complications

Regarding complications affecting the newborn after birth, the findings were a bit mixed:

*   **Preterm Birth:** This was significantly higher in the older maternal age group (10.4% vs. 6.5%).
*   **Other Neonatal Outcomes:** While factors like pH at birth, APGAR scores, and the need for pediatric care after birth were examined, the study generally found **""few significant differences""** for these other neonatal complications between the two age groups. The researchers suggested this might be because other obstetrical factors (like delivery length or abnormalities in fetal heart rhythm) can influence neonatal outcomes independently of maternal age.

In essence, the study strongly concluded that advanced maternal age (40+) is an **independent risk factor** for a range of obstetric and some fetal and neonatal complications, with a pronounced increase in conditions like preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, gestational hypertension, C-sections, and fetal death in utero, as well as preterm birth. However, it's reassuring to note that while these risks are higher, advancements in screening and management mean that a high-risk pregnancy at age 40 today is much better managed than decades ago."

Overview of Major Consumer Finance Markets
The following sections examine specific issues within major consumer debt markets: mortgage
lending, student loans, automobile loans, credit cards and payments, payday loans and other
credit alternative financial products, and checking accounts and substitutes. The markets
discussed are under the jurisdiction of the CFPB, and sometimes other regulators as well. Each
section briefly describes the financial product, recent market developments, and selected policy
issues that may lead each market away from its efficient price or outcomes. These sections focus
on the consumer and household perspective as well as consumer protection policy issues in each
market.
Mortgage Lending Market
A mortgage loan is a loan collateralized by a house and its land.47 Generally, consumers use these
loans to purchase a new home or refinance an existing one. These types of mortgages are often
called first liens, because if a consumer defaults on the loan, the lender is typically the first in line
to be compensated through the proceeds of a home foreclosure. First-lien mortgage loans are
usually installment loans, in which the consumer pays off the loan in monthly installments over
15 years or 30 years. Most mortgage loans in the United States have a fixed interest rate and fixed
installment amount over the course of the loan, affected by the consumer’s credit score and
market conditions.48
Households buying a new home and taking out a mortgage loan to purchase it generally cannot
borrow for the full cost of the house’s value. To limit the risk to the lender, borrowers are
typically required to make a down payment, the difference between the house’s value and the
mortgage loan. If the down payment is less than 20% of the home’s value, the borrower is often
required to pay for additional insurance.
In addition to first-lien purchase mortgages, a consumer may choose to take out a home equity
line of credit (often referred to as HELOC) or a smaller installment mortgage loan, which often is
a second lien. A second lien means that the lender is second in line, after the first lien holder, to be
compensated if the consumer defaults and the home is foreclosed upon. These loans are
underwritten using the value of the home, but can be used for a variety of different purposes
either related to the home or not. For example, second mortgages can be used to renovate the
home, pay for college, or consolidate credit card debts.
Mortgage loans are by far the largest consumer credit market in the United States, and homes are
a large part of most households’ wealth. According to the Fed, more than $9 trillion of mortgage
debt is currently outstanding,49 and more than $20 trillion in real estate equity is owned by households.50 As of the third quarter of 2020, 67.4% of U.S. households owned their home. 51
Many people view homeownership as an important way to build wealth over time, both through
price appreciation and home equity by paying down their mortgage. Nevertheless, because home
prices can fluctuate over time, this investment can be risky, especially if the home owner only
stays in the home for a short time. Although homeownership has certain benefits, such as tax
benefits like the mortgage interest tax deduction,52 it also imposes costs on the household, such as
mortgage loan closing costs and home maintenance.
As noted above, most experts believe that a housing price bubble was a central cause of the 2008
financial crisis. In response, Dodd-Frank reformed the mortgage market by attempting to
strengthen mortgage underwriting standards, to reduce the risk that consumers’ default on their
mortgages, even if house prices fluctuated in the future. Dodd-Frank also directed the CFPB to
update federal mortgage disclosure forms (called the combined TILA/RESPA form) 53 and
improve standards for mortgage servicing (a company who manages mortgage loans after the
loan is originated).54
During and after the financial crisis, mortgage lenders tightened underwriting standards, making
it harder for consumers to qualify for a loan.55 Although most borrowers with good credit scores
continued to qualify for mortgage credit, other borrowers in weaker financial positions found it
more difficult to obtain a mortgage.56 As the economy has recovered from the Great Recession,
concerns exist about whether new consumer compliance regulation in the mortgage market has
struck the right balance between prudent mortgage underwriting and access to credit for potential
borrowers to build wealth.57 Certain features of mortgages during the mortgage boom that were
considered to be particularly risky, such as teaser interest rates and loans with little or no income
verification, are now uncommon in the mortgage market.58 However, research suggests that the
regulation of underwriting standards may have caused lenders to prefer certain borrowers, such as
those with lower debt-to-income ratios.59
Mortgage shopping is another policy issue in this market. Consumers do not tend to shop among
lenders for more advantageous mortgage interest rates, even though large price differences exist in the market. According to the CFPB, nearly half of all borrowers only seriously consider one
lender or broker before taking out a mortgage.60 Given the range of interest rates available to a
consumer at any given time, the CFPB estimates that a consumer could save thousands of dollars
on a mortgage by shopping for the best interest rates.61
More recently, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the mortgage market. Many consumers
who would likely have experienced difficulty repaying their mortgage loans received loan
forbearance.
62 Loan forbearance plans can prevent a consumer from becoming delinquent, giving
the consumer time to repay the debts owed rather than potentially experiencing adverse
consequences, such as credit score declines or foreclosure.63 As previously mentioned, the
CARES Act established consumer rights to be granted forbearance for federally backed
mortgages for up to a year. The CARES Act’s consumer protections and financial institutions’
loan forbearance programs arguably helped avoid sharp increases in loan delinquencies by
making it possible for many loans to receive forbearance during the spring and summer of 2020.64
However, when these programs expire, some consumers may fall delinquent on their loans,
impacting the mortgage market. In addition, during the second and third quarters of 2020,
mortgage debt balances increased as interest rates reached historic lows, causing more mortgage
refinances and other mortgage finance activity.

How does the second lien differ from the first lien?","If a consumer defaults on a loan, the first lien holder is typically the first in line to be compensated through the proceeds of a home foreclosure, whereas the second lien holder is second in line to be compensated after the first lien holder (Mortgage Lending Market).","That's a great question about how different types of mortgage loans work! The distinction between a first lien and a second lien is really important, especially if you're thinking about homeownership or using your home's equity.

Here's how they differ, based on the document and general financial understanding:

1.  **First Lien:**
    *   **Purpose:** This is typically the primary mortgage loan you take out when you **purchase a new home** or **refinance an existing one**. It's the main loan that secures the property.
    *   **Priority in Foreclosure:** If a homeowner defaults on their loan and the home goes into foreclosure, the lender holding the **first lien is compensated first** from the proceeds of the sale. They have the top priority.
    *   **Characteristics:** First-lien mortgages are usually installment loans paid off over 15 or 30 years, often with a fixed interest rate and monthly payment. They typically require a down payment.

2.  **Second Lien:**
    *   **Purpose:** A second lien is an *additional* loan taken out against the value of your home, *after* the first mortgage is already in place. Common examples include a **Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC)** or a smaller installment mortgage loan. Unlike a first lien, which is almost exclusively for buying/refinancing, second liens can be used for a wide variety of purposes, such as:
        *   Home renovations
        *   Paying for college
        *   Consolidating other debts (like credit cards)
        *   Other personal expenses
    *   **Priority in Foreclosure:** This is the most critical difference! If a homeowner defaults and the home is foreclosed upon, the lender holding the **second lien is compensated only *after* the first lien holder has been fully paid.** This means that if the sale proceeds aren't enough to cover both, the second lien holder might receive less or even nothing, making it a riskier position for that lender.

**In simple terms, the main difference boils down to priority:**

Imagine your home's equity as a pie. The first lien holder gets the first slice (and often the biggest one) if things go wrong. Whatever is left, if anything, then goes to the second lien holder.

Both types of loans use your home as collateral, meaning the lender can take possession of your home if you don't make your payments. However, the order in which lenders get paid back significantly impacts their risk and, consequently, the terms they might offer."

47. Before November 30, 2021, Head Start rules (45 C.F.R. § 1302.94(a)) governed volunteer health only to the following limited extent: (a) A program must ensure regular volunteers have been screened for appropriate communicable diseases in accordance with state, tribal or local laws. In the absence of state, tribal or local law, the Health Services Advisory Committee must be consulted regarding the need for such screenings. 
48. But now the Interim Final Rule revises paragraph (a) to read as follows: (a) A program must ensure volunteers have been screened for appropriate communicable diseases in accordance with state, tribal or local laws. In the absence of state, tribal, or local law, the Health Services Advisory Committee must be consulted regarding the need for such screenings. (1) All volunteers in classrooms or working directly with children other than their own must be fully vaccinated for COVID-19, other than those volunteers: (i) For whom a vaccine is medically contraindicated; (ii) For whom medical necessity requires a delay in vaccination; or (iii) Who are legally entitled to an accommodation with regard to the COVID19 vaccination requirements based on an applicable Federal law. (2) Those granted an accommodation outlined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section must undergo SARS-CoV-2 testing for current infection at least weekly with those who have negative test results to remain in the classroom or work directly with children. Those with positive test results must be immediately excluded from the facility, so they are away from children and staff until they are determined to no longer be infectious. 86 Fed. Reg. at 68,101. 
49. The new paragraphs require volunteers to be vaccinated, and to get tested weekly if granted an accommodation against being vaccinated. No such requirement existed in the prior version. 
50. Before November 30, 2021, Head Start rules (45 C.F.R. § 1302.47(b)(5)) governed child safety only to the following limited extent: (5) Safety practices. All staff and consultants follow appropriate practices to keep children safe during all activities, including, at a minimum: (i) Reporting of suspected or known child abuse and neglect, including that staff comply with applicable federal, state, local, and tribal laws; (ii) Safe sleep practices, including ensuring that all sleeping arrangements for children under 18 months of age use firm mattresses or cots, as appropriate, and for children under 12 months, soft bedding materials or toys must not be used; (iii) Appropriate indoor and outdoor supervision of children at all times; (iv) Only releasing children to an authorized adult, and; (v) All standards of conduct described in § 1302.90(c). 9 
51. The Interim Final Rule adds paragraph (b)(5)(vi) to read as follows: (vi) Masking, using masks recommended by CDC, for all individuals 2 years of age or older when there are two or more individuals in a vehicle owned, leased, or arranged by the Head Start program; indoors in a setting when Head Start services are provided; and for those not fully vaccinated, outdoors in crowded settings or during activities that involve sustained close contact with other people, except: (A) Children or adults when they are either eating or drinking; (B) Children when they are napping; (C) When a person cannot wear a mask, or cannot safely wear a mask, because of a disability as defined by the Americans with Disabilities Act; or (D) When a child’s health care provider advises an alternative face covering to accommodate the child’s special health care needs. 86 Fed. Reg. at 68,101. 
52. The new paragraph requires masking. No such requirement existed in the prior version. 
53. Paragraph (vi) applies to all “individuals 2 years of age or older” who are “indoors in a setting when Head Start services are provided” and “outdoors in crowded settings or during activities that involve sustained close contact with other people” According to the Interim Final Rule, “The Office of Head Start notes that being outdoors with children inherently includes sustained close contact for the purposes of caring for and supervising children.” 86 Fed. Reg. at 68,060. Thus, the Mask Mandate appears to also apply to parents who enter a Head Start facility (either when dropping off or picking up their child or at any other time) and to parents are outside with their children (either when dropping them off, picking them up, or at any other time), since being outside with children “inherently includes sustained close contact.”

How did the Interim Final Rule change the Head Start rules that govern child safety?","The Interim Final Rule changed the Head Start rules that govern child safety by adding paragraph (b)(5)(vi) to 45 C.F.R. § 1302.47(b)(5) (86 Fed. Reg. at 68,101). This new paragraph requires masking for all individuals 2 years of age or older when there are two or more individuals in a vehicle owned, leased, or arranged by the Head Start program; indoors in a setting when Head Start services are provided; and for those not fully vaccinated, outdoors in crowded settings or during activities that involve sustained close contact with other people (86 Fed. Reg. at 68,101). Exceptions to this masking requirement include children or adults when eating or drinking, children when napping, persons who cannot wear a mask due to a disability, or when a child's healthcare provider advises an alternative face covering for special health care needs (86 Fed. Reg. at 68,101). Before the Interim Final Rule, no such masking requirement existed (Paragraph 52).","The Interim Final Rule significantly updated Head Start's child safety rules by introducing a new masking requirement, which did not exist in the prior version of the regulations.

Here's a breakdown of the changes:

*   **Before November 30, 2021:** The Head Start rules for child safety (45 C.F.R. § 1302.47(b)(5)) focused on practices like reporting child abuse and neglect, ensuring safe sleep for infants, maintaining appropriate indoor and outdoor supervision, releasing children only to authorized adults, and following established standards of conduct.
*   **After the Interim Final Rule:** A new paragraph, (b)(5)(vi), was added to the child safety rules, establishing a **masking mandate**. This mandate requires:
    *   **Masking for all individuals 2 years of age or older** in several scenarios:
        *   When there are two or more people in a vehicle owned, leased, or arranged by the Head Start program.
        *   Indoors in any setting where Head Start services are provided.
        *   For individuals not fully vaccinated, outdoors in crowded settings or during activities that involve sustained close contact with other people. The Office of Head Start clarified that ""being outdoors with children inherently includes sustained close contact.""
    *   **Exceptions to the masking rule** are provided for:
        *   Children or adults when they are eating or drinking.
        *   Children when they are napping.
        *   When a person cannot wear a mask, or cannot safely wear one, due to a disability as defined by the Americans with Disabilities Act.
        *   When a child's healthcare provider advises an alternative face covering to accommodate special health care needs.

Essentially, the Interim Final Rule expanded the definition of child safety to include specific public health measures related to communicable diseases, primarily by mandating mask usage in various program settings for children aged 2 and above, staff, and even parents when interacting with the facility or children."

Clinical Manifestations
 Rabies virus causes acute infection of the central nervous system. Five general stages are recognized in humans: incubation, prodrome, acute neurologic period, coma, and death. The incubation period is exceptionally variable, ranging from fewer than 10 days to longer than 2 years, but is usually 1–3 months.
 

 Structure
 Rabies virus is a rod- or bullet-shaped, single-stranded, negative-sense, unsegmented, enveloped RNA virus. The virus genome encodes five proteins.
 

 Classification and Antigenic Types
 Placement within the family is based on the distinctive morphology of the virus particle. Cross- reactive nucleoprotein antigens or comparative genomic sequences determine inclusion in the genus Lyssavirus, which includes rabies virus and at least five other pathogenic rabies-like viruses.
 

 Multiplication
 The viral RNA uncoats in the cytoplasm of infected cells. The genome is transcribed by a virion-associated RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Viral RNA is then translated into individual viral proteins. Replication occurs with synthesis of positive-stranded RNA templates for the production of progeny negative-stranded RNA.
 

 Pathogenesis
 After inoculation, rabies virus may enter the peripheral nervous system directly and migrates to the brain or may replicate in muscle tissue, remaining sequestered at or near the entry site during incubation, prior to central nervous system invasion and replication. It then spreads centrifugally to numerous other organs. The case:fatality ratio approaches unity, but exact pathogenic mechanisms are not fully understood.
 

 Host Defenses
 Susceptibility to lethal infection is related to the animal species, viral variant, inoculum concentration, location and severity of exposure, and host immune status. Both virus-neutralizing antibodies and cell-mediated immunity are important in host defense.
 

 Epidemiology
 Rabies occurs in nearly all countries. Disease in humans is almost always due to a bite by an infected mammal. Nonbite exposures (e.g., mucosal contact) rarely cause rabies in humans.
 

 Diagnosis
 Early diagnosis is difficult. Rabies should be suspected in human cases of unexplained viral encephalitis with a history of animal bite. Unvaccinated persons are often negative for virus-neutralizing antibodies until late in the course of disease. Virus isolation from saliva, positive immunofluorescent skin biopsies or virus neutralizing antibody (from cerebrospinal fluid, or serum of a non-vaccinated patient), establish a diagnosis.
 

 Control
 Vaccination of susceptible animal species, particularly dogs and cats, will control this zoonotic disease.
 

 Introduction
 The family Rhabdoviridae consists of more than 100 single-stranded, negative-sense, nonsegmented viruses that infect a wide variety of hosts, including vertebrates, invertebrates, and plants. Common to all members of the family is a distinctive rod- or bullet-shaped morphology. Human pathogens of medical importance are found in the genera Lyssavirus and Vesiculovirus.Only rabies virus, medically the most significant member of the genus Lyssavirus, is reviewed in this chapter.
 

 Clinical Manifestations
 Five general stages of rabies are recognized in humans: incubation, prodrome, acute neurologic period, coma, and death (or, very rarely, recovery) (Fig. 61-1). No specific antirabies agents are useful once clinical signs or symptoms develop. The incubation period in rabies, usually 30 to 90 days but ranging from as few as 5 days to longer than 2 years after initial exposure, is more variable than in any other acute infection. Incubation periods may be somewhat shorter in children and in individuals bitten close to the central nervous system (e.g., the head). Clinical symptoms are first noted during the prodromal period, which usually lasts from 2 to 10 days. These symptoms are often nonspecific (general malaise, fever, and fatigue) or suggest involvement of the respiratory system (sore throat, cough, and dyspnea), gastrointestinal system (anorexia, dysphagia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea), or central nervous systems (headache, vertigo, anxiety, apprehension, irritability, and nervousness). More remarkable abnormalities (agitation, photophobia, priapism, increased libido, insomnia, nightmares, and depression) may also occur, suggesting encephalitis, psychiatric disturbances, or brain conditions. Pain or paresthesia at the site of virus inoculation, combined with a history of recent animal bite, should suggest a consideration of rabies.
 

 The acute neurologic period begins with objective signs of central nervous system dysfunction. The disease may be classified as furious rabies if hyperactivity (i.e., hydrophobia) predominates and as dumb rabies if paralysis dominates the clinical picture. Fever, paresthesia, nuchal rigidity, muscle fasciculations, focal and generalized convulsions, hyperventilation, and hypersalivation may occur in both forms of the disease.
 

 At the end of the acute neurologic phase, periods of rapid, irregular breathing may begin; paralysis and coma soon follow. Respiratory arrest may occur thereafter, unless the patient is receiving ventilatory assistance, which may prolong survival for days, weeks, or longer, with death due to other complications.
 

 Although life support measures can prolong the clinical course of rabies, rarely will they affect the outcome of disease. The possibility of recovery, however, must be recognized, and when resources permit, every effort should be made to support the patient. At least seven cases of human “recovery” have been documented.
 

 Structure
 The rabies virus is a negative-sense, non-segmented, single-stranded RNA virus measuring approximately 60 nm × 180 nm. It is composed of an internal protein core or nucleocapsid, containing the nucleic acid, and an outer envelope, a lipid-containing bilayer covered with transmembrane glycoprotein spikes.
 

 The virus genome encodes five proteins associated with either the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex or the viral envelope (Fig. 61-3). The L (transcriptase), N (nucleoprotein), and NS (transcriptase-associated) proteins comprise the RNP complex, together with the viral RNA. These aggregate in the cytoplasm of virus-infected neurons and compose Negri bodies, the characteristic histopathologic finding of rabies virus infection. The M (matrix) and G (glycoprotein) proteins are associated with the lipid envelope. The G protein forms the protrusions that cover the outer surface of the virion envelope and is the only rabies virus protein known to induce virus-neutralizing antibody.
 

 

 Classification and Antigenic Types
 The genus Lyssavirus includes rabies virus and the antigenically- and genetically-related rabies- like viruses: Lagos bat, Mokola, and Duvenhage viruses, and two suggested subtypes of European bat lyssaviruses. Cross-protection studies suggest that animals immunized with traditional rabies vaccines may not be fully protected if challenged with other lyssaviruses.
 

 Rabies viruses may be categorized as either fixed (adapted by passage in animals or cell culture) or street (wild type). The use of monoclonal antibodies and genetic sequencing to differentiate street rabies viruses has been helpful in identifying viral variants originating in major host reservoirs throughout the world and suggesting the likely sources of human exposure when a history of definitive animal bite was otherwise missing from a patient's case history.
 

 Multiplication
 The replication of rabies virus is believed to be similar to that of other negative-stranded RNA viruses. The virus attaches to the host cell membranes via the G protein, penetrates the cytoplasm by fusion or pinocytosis, and is uncoated to RNP. The core initiates primary transcription of the five complementary monocistronic messenger RNAs by using the virion-associated RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Each RNA is then translated into an individual viral protein. After viral proteins have been synthesized, replication of the genomic RNA continues with the synthesis of full length, positive-stranded RNA, which acts as a template for the production of progeny negative-stranded RNA.

Explain the clinical symptoms of rhabdovirus in under 600 words and so a 5th grader can understand. At the end of the explanation, provide a description of the virus in bold print.","Imagine a tiny, tiny germ called the rabies virus gets into your body, usually from an animal bite (Epidemiology). Once it's inside, it can cause a serious sickness (Clinical Manifestations).

Doctors say there are five main steps that happen when someone gets sick with rabies (Clinical Manifestations).

First is the **incubation period**. This is like a quiet time where you don't feel sick at all, even though the virus is inside (Clinical Manifestations). This quiet time can be different for everyone. It usually lasts about 1 to 3 months, but it could be as short as less than 10 days or even longer than 2 years! If a child gets bitten, or if the bite is close to their head (like on the head), this quiet time might be a bit shorter (Clinical Manifestations).

Next is the **prodromal period**. This is when you start to feel a little sick, but it's hard to tell what it is (Clinical Manifestations). It's like having a cold or feeling tired, and this period usually lasts for 2 to 10 days (Clinical Manifestations). You might have a fever, feel tired, or just feel generally unwell (general malaise, fatigue) (Clinical Manifestations). Some kids might get a sore throat or cough, or have trouble breathing (dyspnea) (Clinical Manifestations). Others might have a stomach ache (abdominal pain), feel like throwing up (nausea, vomiting), or have diarrhea (Clinical Manifestations). Headaches, feeling dizzy (vertigo), worried (anxiety, apprehension), irritable, or nervous can also happen (Clinical Manifestations). Sometimes, kids might become agitated, sensitive to bright lights (photophobia), have trouble sleeping (insomnia), or even have nightmares (Clinical Manifestations). If you also feel pain or a tingly feeling (paresthesia) where the animal bite happened, that's a big sign for doctors to think about rabies (Clinical Manifestations).

After that comes the **acute neurologic period**. This is when the virus starts affecting the brain more strongly and clear signs of central nervous system problems begin (Clinical Manifestations). There are two ways this can look. Some people might get ""furious rabies,"" which means they become very, very active (hyperactivity) and might even be scared of water (hydrophobia) (Clinical Manifestations). Other people might get ""dumb rabies,"" where they become very weak and paralyzed (paralysis) (Clinical Manifestations). In both types, kids might have a fever, tingly feelings (paresthesia), a stiff neck (nuchal rigidity), muscles that twitch (muscle fasciculations), or even seizures (focal and generalized convulsions) (Clinical Manifestations). They might also breathe very fast (hyperventilation) and drool a lot (hypersalivation) (Clinical Manifestations).

As the sickness gets worse, breathing can become uneven and fast (rapid, irregular breathing) (Clinical Manifestations). Then, the body might become paralyzed, and the person could go into a deep sleep called a coma (Clinical Manifestations). Without help from machines that assist with breathing (ventilatory assistance), breathing can stop (respiratory arrest) (Clinical Manifestations).

It's very, very sad, but usually, rabies leads to death (Clinical Manifestations). However, doctors have seen a few times where people have gotten better, but it's extremely rare (At least seven cases of human “recovery” have been documented) (Clinical Manifestations).

**The rabies virus is a rod- or bullet-shaped, single-stranded, negative-sense, unsegmented, enveloped RNA virus (Structure). It measures about 60 nm × 180 nm (Structure). It has an internal protein core (nucleocapsid) with its nucleic acid and an outer envelope (Structure). This envelope is a lipid layer covered with glycoprotein spikes (Structure). The virus's genetic material (genome) encodes five proteins (Structure).**","Imagine a tiny, tiny invader called the rabies virus gets into your body, usually from a bite from an infected animal like a dog, bat, or wild animal. It's a very serious illness that affects your brain and nerves, which are like the control center for your whole body!

When the virus first enters, you usually don't feel anything for a while. This is called the **incubation period**. It's like the virus is quietly traveling inside you, making its way to your brain. This quiet time can last for a month or two, but sometimes it can be as short as 5 days or even longer than two years, depending on where the bite was.

After this quiet time, you might start to feel a bit off. This is called the **prodrome stage**, and it usually lasts for about 2 to 10 days. It's a lot like getting the flu, so it can be tricky to tell what's happening. You might feel:
*   A general yucky feeling, like you're tired or don't have energy (malaise).
*   A fever.
*   A sore throat or cough, or maybe trouble breathing.
*   Stomach aches, throwing up, or diarrhea.
*   Headaches, dizziness, or feel nervous, anxious, or irritable.
*   **A very important sign:** You might feel pain, tingling, or itching right where the animal bit you, even if the bite has healed a long time ago! This is a big clue, especially if you remember being bitten by an animal recently.

Next comes the **acute neurologic period**, which means the virus is really affecting your brain and nerves. This is when things get very serious and people show clearer signs. There are two main types of symptoms:

*   **""Furious rabies"":** People become very agitated, restless, and sometimes aggressive. They might have a strong fear of water (called hydrophobia), where even just seeing water can cause painful spasms in their throat, making it very hard to drink. They might also drool a lot, breathe very fast, have stiff necks, muscle twitches, and even seizures (like fits).
*   **""Dumb rabies"":** Instead of being agitated, people become very quiet, and their muscles start to get weak and paralyzed (meaning they can't move them). This paralysis spreads through the body.

Eventually, if the illness isn't treated in time, the person's breathing becomes very irregular, the paralysis worsens, and they go into a **coma** (a very deep sleep where they can't wake up). Sadly, death usually follows because the body's systems shut down. It's very, very rare for someone to recover once these serious symptoms start. That's why getting medical help right away after a suspected animal bite is incredibly important!

**The rabies virus is a unique, rod- or bullet-shaped, single-stranded RNA virus. It has an outer protective layer called an envelope and causes an acute infection of your central nervous system, which includes your brain and spinal cord.**"

When should egfr be considered?","eGFR should be considered in the following situations:
*   Farxiga is not recommended for use to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus with an eGFR less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 (""FDA Approved Indication(s)"").
*   Jardiance is not recommended for use to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (""FDA Approved Indication(s)"").
*   For initial approval of Farxiga for chronic kidney disease, an eGFR between 25 and 75 mL/min/1.73 m2 is required (""I. Initial Approval Criteria"", ""C. Chronic Kidney Disease"", ""4.a"").","The estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) is an important factor to consider when prescribing SGLT2 inhibitors, particularly for certain conditions and specific medications. Here's a breakdown of when eGFR should be considered, based on the document:

1.  **For Glycemic Control in Type 2 Diabetes:**
    *   **Farxiga:** It's **not recommended** to use Farxiga to improve blood sugar control in adults with type 2 diabetes if their eGFR is **less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m2**. The document states it's likely to be ineffective in this scenario.
    *   **Jardiance:** Similarly, Jardiance is **not recommended** for improving glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes if their eGFR is **less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2**, also due to anticipated ineffectiveness.

2.  **For Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Treatment with Farxiga:**
    *   If Farxiga is being requested to treat chronic kidney disease, an eGFR measurement is a crucial approval criterion. The member's eGFR must be **between 25 and 75 mL/min/1.73 m2**. This means it needs to be within this specific range for the medication to be covered for CKD.

In essence, eGFR helps determine if these medications will be effective for controlling blood sugar and whether they are appropriate for treating CKD in specific situations. It's a critical measure of kidney function that guides treatment decisions."

A number of notes, emails, and presentations from Microsoft were made public due to a lawsuit filed against the company after the launch of Windows Vista. The Windows Vista era of Microsoft was plagued by bugs, delays, compatibility problems, and a general shrugging of shoulders from computer users. Microsoft reduced the graphics requirements for new Windows XP machines to receive the ""Vista capable"" designation, which signaled their suitability to run what was then the upcoming version of the operating system. Microsoft lowered the graphics requirement to help Intel ""make their quarterly earnings, so they could continue to sell motherboards with 915 graphics embedded"". As a result of lowering the graphics requirements, many of the Windows Vista qualified XP machines were unable to run Vista's signature features, with user's instead getting a stripped down version of the operating system, which caused confusion and challenges. The internal emails offer a vivid glimpse into what was happening inside Microsoft during this time. Highlights of these emails include then-CEO Steve Ballmer providing tech support to then-Microsoft board member Jon Shirley, who was struggling to get his scanners to work with Windows Vista due to a lack of drivers. Steven Sinofsky, the executive who was brought in to lead Windows development after repeated delays with Windows Vista, wrote about his own problems with Vista, as well as some insights he picked up from listening to customers at a Best Buy store. There is also a page of notes from an unidentified executive outlining the challenges of Microsoft's two-tiered approach to the Windows Vista versions. There is also documents pertaining to Dell's Windows Vista launch post mortem, which the PC maker prepared for a meeting with Microsoft's team. One of the slides shows how hard it is to say something good about Windows Vista. There is also a bona-fied Harvard Business School case-study about Windows Vista, which was published in 2009 by then-Harvard professor Ben Edelman. As the writer was dusting off old computers searching for audio from past-interviews, they stumbled upon a long-forgotten archive of Internal Microsoft emails, presentations, and notes, circa 2005-2007, which details the troubled Windows Vista-era. All of these documents were made public as a result of a lawsuit that was filed a few years after the launch of Windows Vista. The reason all these documents are being revisited is because Microsoft's 50th anniversary is next year, which they say is the perfect time to reconsider its history, and to take a new look at where the company is going. Many amazing moments from Microsoft's past will be remembered and celebrated to mark this milestone, however, the failure of Windows Vista will not be one of them. The writer of the article managed to find several pieces of audio from interviews they had with Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer, which they offered to Acquired's Ben Gilbert to help with his research for the Microsoft Volume II series. Ben Gillbert and co-host David Rosenthal are known for getting extensive background material for their show, which explorers the history and strategies of well known businesses and brands.

Give me the insights on the problems people faced with Windows Vista from a forgotten trove of internal Microsoft emails in 500 words or less.","The forgotten trove of internal Microsoft emails, presentations, and notes, circa 2005-2007, made public due to a lawsuit, offer several insights into the problems people faced with Windows Vista.

Internal emails revealed that even high-level individuals struggled with basic functionality, such as then-CEO Steve Ballmer providing tech support to then-Microsoft board member Jon Shirley, who could not get his scanners to work with Windows Vista due to a lack of drivers (Microsoft emails). Steven Sinofsky, an executive leading Windows development, wrote about his own problems with Vista and gathered insights from listening to customers at a Best Buy store (Sinofsky's writings).

Furthermore, a page of notes from an unidentified executive outlined the challenges of Microsoft's two-tiered approach to the Windows Vista versions (notes from an unidentified executive). Documents also showed that Microsoft had reduced graphics requirements for new Windows XP machines to receive the ""Vista capable"" designation to help Intel with their quarterly earnings (Microsoft notes, emails, and presentations). This decision resulted in many Windows Vista qualified XP machines being unable to run Vista's signature features, leading users to receive a stripped-down version of the operating system, which caused confusion and challenges (Microsoft notes, emails, and presentations).

Additionally, documents from Dell's Windows Vista launch post mortem, prepared for a meeting with Microsoft's team, included a slide that illustrated how difficult it was to say something positive about Windows Vista (Dell's Windows Vista launch post mortem documents).","Oh, what a fascinating (and somewhat cringe-worthy for Microsoft) glimpse into the past these internal documents provide! The ""forgotten trove"" of Microsoft emails, presentations, and notes from the 2005-2007 Windows Vista era really sheds light on the myriad problems users faced, exposing a product launch fraught with issues and user disappointment.

Here are some key insights into the problems people encountered with Windows Vista, straight from Microsoft's own internal communications:

1.  **Misleading ""Vista Capable"" Label:** One of the most significant issues stemmed from Microsoft's decision to lower the graphics requirements for new Windows XP machines to receive the ""Vista capable"" designation. This was done, in part, to help Intel meet their quarterly earnings. However, the consequence for users was severe: many of these ""qualified"" XP machines were ultimately unable to run Vista's signature graphical features. Users often ended up with a stripped-down version of the operating system, leading to immense confusion, frustration, and a sense of being misled. They expected a rich, new experience but received a limited one.

2.  **Pervasive Driver and Compatibility Issues:** The documents highlight a severe lack of driver support and general compatibility problems. This wasn't just an issue for a few niche peripherals; it impacted basic functionality. In one telling example, then-CEO Steve Ballmer himself was found providing tech support to Microsoft board member Jon Shirley because Shirley was struggling to get his scanners to work with Windows Vista due to a lack of drivers. If a board member had trouble, imagine the headaches for everyday users with various hardware!

3.  **Executive Frustration Mirroring User Experience:** Even Microsoft's own leadership and development team struggled with Vista. Steven Sinofsky, the executive brought in to lead Windows development after repeated delays, documented his *own* problems with Vista. He also gained insights into user frustration by simply listening to customers at a Best Buy store, indicating widespread public dissatisfaction.

4.  **Confusing ""Two-Tiered Approach"":** Notes from an unidentified executive outlined the challenges of Microsoft's ""two-tiered approach"" to the Windows Vista versions. This likely contributed to user confusion and unmet expectations when different versions offered varying features, making it hard for customers to understand what they were truly getting.

5.  **Difficulty in Finding Positive Aspects:** Dell's internal ""launch post mortem"" documents, prepared for a meeting with Microsoft, starkly revealed ""how hard it is to say something good about Windows Vista."" This sentiment from a key hardware partner underscores the overwhelmingly negative user experience and the difficulty in promoting a product that was causing so much grief.

In essence, these internal documents confirm that users were often left with an operating system that was buggy, suffered from poor hardware compatibility, felt misleading in its promises, and created more confusion than seamless functionality. It was a tough period for anyone trying to use the latest version of Windows."
"DOCUMENT:
A grand jury indicted former President Donald J. Trump on four counts for conduct that occurred during his Presidency following the November 2020 election. The indictment alleged that after losing that election, Trump conspired to overturn it by spreading knowingly false claims of election fraud to obstruct the collecting, counting, and certifying of the election results. Trump moved to dismiss the indictment based on Presidential immunity, arguing that a President has absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for actions performed within the outer perimeter of his official responsibilities, and that the indictment’s allegations fell within the core of his official duties. The District Court denied Trump’s motion to dismiss, holding that former Presidents do not possess federal criminal immunity for any acts. The D. C. Circuit affirmed. Both the District Court and the D. C. Circuit declined to decide whether the indicted conduct involved official acts.
 Held: Under our constitutional structure of separated powers, the nature of Presidential power entitles a former President to absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for actions within his conclusive and preclusive constitutional authority. And he is entitled to at least presumptive immunity from prosecution for all his official acts. There is no immunity for unofficial acts. Pp. 5–43.
 (a) This case is the first criminal prosecution in our Nation’s history of a former President for actions taken during his Presidency. Determining whether and under what circumstances such a prosecution may proceed requires careful assessment of the scope of Presidential power under the Constitution. The nature of that power requires that a former President have some immunity from criminal prosecution for official acts during his tenure in office. At least with respect to the President’s exercise of his core constitutional powers, this immunity must be absolute. As for his remaining official actions, he is entitled to at least presumptive immunity. Pp. 5–15
 (1) Article II of the Constitution vests “executive Power” in “a President of the United States of America.” §1, cl. 1. The President has duties of “unrivaled gravity and breadth.” Trump v. Vance, 591 U. S. 786, 800. His authority to act necessarily “stem[s] either from an act of Congress or from the Constitution itself.” Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579, 585. In the latter case, the President’s authority is sometimes “conclusive and preclusive.” Id., at 638 (Jackson, J., concurring). When the President exercises such authority, Congress cannot act on, and courts cannot examine, the President’s actions. It follows that an Act of Congress—either a specific one targeted at the President or a generally applicable one—may not criminalize the President’s actions within his exclusive constitutional power. Neither may the courts adjudicate a criminal prosecution that examines such Presidential actions. The Court thus concludes that the President is absolutely immune from criminal prosecution for conduct within his exclusive sphere of constitutional authority. Pp. 6–9.
 2) Not all of the President’s official acts fall within his “conclusive and preclusive” authority. The reasons that justify the President’s absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for acts within the scope of his exclusive constitutional authority do not extend to conduct in areas where his authority is shared with Congress. To determine the President’s immunity in this context, the Court looks primarily to the Framers’ design of the Presidency within the separation of powers, precedent on Presidential immunity in the civil context, and criminal cases where a President resisted prosecutorial demands for documents. P. 9.
  (i) The Framers designed the Presidency to provide for a “vigorous” and “energetic” Executive. The Federalist No. 70, pp. 471–472 (J. Cooke ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton). They vested the President with “supervisory and policy responsibilities of utmost discretion and sensitivity.” Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 731, 750. Appreciating the “unique risks” that arise when the President’s energies are diverted by proceedings that might render him “unduly cautious in the discharge of his official duties,” the Court has recognized Presidential immunities and privileges “rooted in the constitutional tradition of the separation of powers and supported by our history.” Id., at 749, 751, 752, n. 32. In Fitzgerald, for instance, the Court concluded that a former President is entitled to absolute immunity from “damages liability for acts within the ‘outer perimeter’ of his official responsibility.” Id., at 756. The Court’s “dominant concern” was to avoid “diversion of the President’s attention during the decision-making process caused by needless worry as to the possibility of damages actions stemming from any particular official decision.” Clinton v. Jones, 520 U. S. 681, 694, n. 19.

USER REQUEST:
Can a President be charged with a crime for his or her actions taken while President? If not, are there any exceptions to a get-out-of-jail-free card?","A former President is entitled to absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for actions within his conclusive and preclusive constitutional authority, and at least presumptive immunity from prosecution for all his official acts (Pp. 5–43). This absolute immunity applies to the President's exercise of his core constitutional powers and conduct within his exclusive sphere of constitutional authority (Pp. 5–15, Pp. 6–9).

There are exceptions to this immunity. There is no immunity for unofficial acts (Pp. 5–43). Additionally, the reasons justifying absolute immunity for acts within the scope of exclusive constitutional authority do not extend to conduct in areas where the President's authority is shared with Congress (P. 9).","That's a really important question that the Supreme Court has recently weighed in on, and the answer is nuanced, depending on the nature of the President's actions while in office.

Based on the recent Supreme Court decision, here's the breakdown:

**Can a former President be charged with a crime for actions taken while President?**

Yes, but with significant caveats and protections for ""official acts."" The Court has established a framework that grants varying levels of immunity based on whether the actions were ""official"" or ""unofficial,"" and, if official, how central they were to the President's constitutional duties.

**Here are the ""exceptions to a get-out-of-jail-free card"" (or rather, when immunity *doesn't* apply or is less strong):**

1.  **No Immunity for Unofficial Acts:** This is the clearest ""exception."" If a President's actions are deemed **unofficial**, they receive no immunity from criminal prosecution. This means that for any conduct outside the scope of their official duties, a former President can be charged just like any other citizen.
2.  **Presumptive Immunity for Most Official Acts:** For many of their official actions, a former President is entitled to at least **presumptive immunity** from criminal prosecution. This is a crucial distinction from ""absolute"" immunity. While the document doesn't fully detail how this presumption can be overcome, the term ""presumptive"" implies that it is not impenetrable. It suggests that while the default is immunity, prosecutors could potentially present a case to overcome that presumption, possibly by demonstrating the alleged acts went beyond the legitimate exercise of their office.
3.  **No Absolute Immunity for Shared Authority:** The Court noted that the reasons for absolute immunity don't extend to conduct in areas where the President's authority is *shared* with Congress. This suggests that actions taken where the President and legislative branch both have a role might fall under the ""presumptive"" category, making them more vulnerable to prosecution than actions within the President's exclusive domain.

**When is there stronger immunity?**

*   **Absolute Immunity for Core Constitutional Powers:** The Court ruled that a former President is entitled to **absolute immunity** from criminal prosecution for actions that fall within their ""conclusive and preclusive constitutional authority"" – essentially, their core, exclusive constitutional powers. For these specific and fundamental exercises of presidential power, there is an absolute bar to criminal prosecution.

**Why these distinctions?**

The Court's reasoning is rooted in the constitutional structure of separated powers, aiming to ensure a ""vigorous"" and ""energetic"" executive. The idea is to prevent Presidents from being ""unduly cautious"" or distracted from their duties by the constant worry of potential criminal charges for official decisions, which could undermine the effective functioning of the presidency.

**In summary:** A former President does *not* have a blanket ""get-out-of-jail-free card."" They can certainly be charged for **unofficial acts**. For **official acts**, they receive immunity, but the strength of that immunity varies. It's absolute for core constitutional duties, but only presumptive for other official actions, implying that it could potentially be challenged and overcome under certain circumstances."
"DOCUMENT:
Several different federal laws protect workers from discrimination based on pregnancy. The
oldest of these, the Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA), generally protects job applicants and
employees from adverse action—for example, firing, demotion, refusal to hire, or forced leave—
because of pregnancy or related conditions. The PDA also addresses harassment based on
pregnancy and bans retaliation against workers for making complaints about pregnancy
discrimination. Pregnancy-related conditions can include fertility treatments, medical
complications, delivery, postpartum conditions, and lactation. The PDA was enacted as an
amendment to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which protects against sex discrimination (as well as certain other
forms of discrimination) in employment.
As construed by the Supreme Court, the PDA does not generally require employers to make changes in working conditions to
accommodate pregnant workers unless employers provide accommodations to other similarly situated nonpregnant workers.
So while employers cannot fire workers for being pregnant, this statute (depending on the facts) may not require them to
make workplace changes (e.g., scheduling flexibility, an extra bathroom break) simply because employees’ demands are
pregnancy-related.
The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (PWFA), passed in 2022 and effective June 27, 2023, mandates additional protections for
pregnant workers. Modeled on the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), it requires employers to modify workplace
conditions where needed to accommodate pregnancy-related conditions as long as an accommodation is reasonable and does
not present an undue hardship to the employer. The PWFA requires a reasonable accommodation, after a case-specific
assessment, even if a pregnancy-related condition does not amount to a disability, and even if the accommodation includes
reassignment of an essential job function. Relief from an essential job function is only required, however, if it is temporary.
In addition, under the PWFA, an employer may not require an employee to take leave if a reasonable accommodation would
allow her to keep working.
Some pregnant people face pregnancy-related impairments serious enough to satisfy the ADA’s definition of a “disability”
and may, along with any PDA or PWFA claims, bring ADA claims for accommodations. Separately, many workers can
invoke the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) for unpaid leave for pregnancy-related medical needs. After childbirth,
provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) entitle most nursing mothers to appropriate breaks and accommodations
for expressing breast milk.
Preceding the passage of the PWFA, many advocates and legislators proposed expanding legal protections for pregnancy.
Proposals included new pregnancy accommodation requirements (modeled on disability law), antidiscrimination measures
(expanding current statutes), and leave entitlements (in line with many analogous mandates for reemployment rights or leave
entitlements to protect workers engaged in endeavors such as military service). The PWFA focused on this first approach:
accommodations. In addition, many states have strengthened rights for pregnant workers in recent years, and the PWFA does
not preempt those laws when they offer greater protection. 

USER REQUEST:
Question: What limitations of the PDA were solved for with the PWFA?","The Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA) generally did not require employers to make changes in working conditions to accommodate pregnant workers unless those employers provided accommodations to other similarly situated nonpregnant workers, meaning it ""may not require them to make workplace changes (e.g., scheduling flexibility, an extra bathroom break) simply because employees’ demands are pregnancy-related"" (Pregnancy Discrimination Act).

The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (PWFA) solved this limitation by mandating that employers ""modify workplace conditions where needed to accommodate pregnancy-related conditions as long as an accommodation is reasonable and does not present an undue hardship to the employer"" (The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (PWFA)). This includes requiring a reasonable accommodation even if a pregnancy-related condition does not amount to a disability, and potentially includes temporary reassignment of an essential job function (The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (PWFA)). Additionally, under the PWFA, ""an employer may not require an employee to take leave if a reasonable accommodation would allow her to keep working"" (The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (PWFA)).","That's a great question, and the document clearly lays out how the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (PWFA) stepped in to address a significant limitation of the older Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA).

Here's the core limitation of the PDA that the PWFA solved for:

*   **Lack of a General Requirement for Accommodations:**
    The PDA, as interpreted by the Supreme Court, **did not generally require employers to make changes in working conditions to accommodate pregnant workers.** Employers only had to provide accommodations to pregnant workers if they *already* provided similar accommodations to other non-pregnant workers who were similarly situated. This meant that while an employer couldn't fire you for being pregnant, they might not have been legally required to offer simple things like scheduling flexibility or extra bathroom breaks, *unless* they were already doing so for others.

**How the PWFA Solved This:**

The PWFA, which became effective in June 2023, directly filled this gap by **mandating that employers provide reasonable accommodations** for pregnancy-related conditions.

Here's how it changed things:

1.  **Direct Mandate for Reasonable Accommodations:** Unlike the PDA, the PWFA *requires* employers to modify workplace conditions to accommodate pregnancy-related conditions. This applies as long as the accommodation is reasonable and doesn't cause an undue hardship for the employer.
2.  **Broader Scope of Conditions:** The PWFA requires these accommodations even if the pregnancy-related condition doesn't meet the definition of a ""disability"" under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).
3.  **Temporary Reassignment of Essential Job Functions:** It even allows for the temporary reassignment of essential job functions as a reasonable accommodation.
4.  **Protection Against Forced Leave:** The PWFA prevents employers from forcing an employee to take leave if a reasonable accommodation would allow them to continue working.

In essence, the PDA primarily focused on preventing outright discrimination (like firing or demoting someone *because* they were pregnant). The PWFA expanded on this by ensuring that pregnant workers also receive the necessary **workplace adjustments and support** to continue performing their jobs safely and effectively, much like disability law provides for individuals with disabilities. This was a significant step forward in protecting pregnant workers' ability to remain employed and healthy throughout their pregnancies and postpartum periods."

Overview of Spain Permanent Residence Permit
 There are substantial benefits of living in Spain and having Permanent Residency status. Advantages of getting a Permanent Residency card in Spain include having many of the same rights as Spanish citizens. With Permanent Residency you are entitled to work, study and access healthcare.
 

 It does not give you the right to vote in national elections or hold a Spanish passport – these rights are only available to those who hold full Spanish citizenship.
 

 However, obtaining Permanent Residency is a major step towards eventually obtaining citizenship of Spain.
 

 

 Qualifying for Permanent Residency in Spain
 There are conditions that must be met before applying for Permanent Residency in Spain. You should ensure you meet all the criteria before applying otherwise you could risk refusal – which can be costly and impact on future immigration applications.
 

 If you are unclear if you do qualify for Permanent Residency then you may want to consider contacting an immigration specialist to seek advice.
 

 The following are able to acquire the right of permanent residence once five years of continuous living legally in Spain has been reached:
 

 Citizens of a EU state and family members who not EU state nationals
 Workers or those self-employed who have reached pension age – as long as they have worked in Spain for the previous 12 months.
 Self-employed workers who opt for early retirement – although they must have been working in Spain for the previous year before applying.
 Workers or self-employed who worked in Spain but have had to stop working due to permanent incapacity to work.
 Workers or self-employed workers who have worked and lived in Spain for three years and have then worked in another EU country but have continued to have a place of residence in Spain which they have returned to at least once a week.
 Non-EU national family members of a Spanish citizen or EU citizen who have been living in Spain for five years as long as the family relationship still exists – or if the relationship has ended due to dealth, annulment or divorce.
 Documents Required When Applying For Residency in Spain
 In order to be eligible for the benefits associated with gaining a Permanent Residency in Spain, the candidate must provide documentation attesting to their legal residency during the previous five years. When you have completed the necessary duration of time in Spain, you can apply for a Permanent Residency visa.
 

 You must go to the appropriate police station in Spain with the application form and required paperwork, as well as the funds to pay the processing fee.
 

 You must submit your application for Permanent Residence at least three months prior to your present visa or permission expiration. You will be asked to provide the following documents:

 Cost of Applying for Permanent Residency in Spain
 The cost of applying for Permanent Residency in Spain is relatively low compared to other visa charges. The exact amount required by the Spanish immigration authorities varies depending on a number of factors including the cost of getting documents translated if they are not originally in Spanish.
 

 However, you can expect to pay around 80 euros to submit the application.
 

 

 Renewing Permanent Residency in Spain
 Once your application for Permanent Residency has been approved then you will be issued with a residency card that is valid for five years. You must apply to renew this card before it expires otherwise you could risk your immigration status in Spain.
 

 To renew you will need to complete the appropriate form and submit with the following documents:
 

 Proof of address in Spain
 Original residency card
 Passport
 You are also required to resubmit your fingerprints and pay the Permanent Residency renewal fee.
 

 When you apply to renew your Permanent Resident status you are not required to prove you have lived in the country for the five years preceding the renewal.
 

 However, you may have your application to renewl your Permanent Residency card refused it you have spent more than 12 months outside of Spain or another EU member country.
 

 What if Your Permanent Residency Application is Rejected?
 If your application for Permanent Residency in Spain is rejected then you may be able to appeal the decision if you feel that you have met all the requirements and can demonstrate so.
 

 You will need to file an appeal with the High Court of Justice in Madrid and you must do this within two months of being notified that your application has been refused.
 

 This could be a potentially lengthy process so you should seek advice from Spanish immigration experts to ensure you complete the appeal process correctly and increase your chances of a successful outcome.

What are the most common pathways to allow me to obtain permanent residency in Spain without any significant time or financial commitments required from me?","The provided document does not contain this information. The pathways to permanent residency listed in the document generally require a significant time commitment, such as five years of continuous legal living in Spain, or specific work durations like 12 months for those who have reached pension age or are self-employed opting for early retirement (Qualifying for Permanent Residency in Spain). The document also mentions a processing fee of around 80 euros to submit the application (Cost of Applying for Permanent Residency in Spain).","Based on the information provided in the document, it appears there are **no pathways** to obtaining permanent residency in Spain that do not involve significant time or financial commitments.

Here's why:

*   **Significant Time Commitment:** All the pathways outlined in the document explicitly state a requirement of **five years of continuous legal living in Spain** as a fundamental condition. For instance, this applies to EU citizens and their non-EU family members, workers (employed or self-employed), those who have reached pension age or taken early retirement, and non-EU family members of Spanish or EU citizens. There's also a specific scenario for workers who spent three years in Spain before working in another EU country, but they still needed to maintain residence in Spain.
*   **Significant Financial Commitment (Proof of Means):** The application process requires you to ""Provide proof of income, investments, or financial means of support, such as bank statements, tax returns, payroll, etc."" This demonstrates that you can financially support yourself, which is a significant financial commitment. While the application fee itself is relatively low (around 80 euros), proving ongoing financial stability is a key requirement.

In essence, the document highlights that permanent residency in Spain is a status earned after a substantial period of legal residency and by demonstrating financial self-sufficiency. It's a significant step towards citizenship, indicating it's not a status granted without considerable investment of time and resources.

If you are looking for options with fewer commitments, you might be considering other types of visas or temporary residency permits, but these are distinct from permanent residency. It's always a good idea to consult an immigration specialist to understand all your options based on your specific circumstances."

In late 2019, a novel beta coronavirus emerged in Wuhan, China, and rapidly spread worldwide. The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has a high potential of a pandemic due to its high contagious rate with high mortality globally (Sharma et al. 2020; Su et al. 2020; Wibawa 2021). Therefore, substantial efforts are needed to develop effective vaccines or therapies against the disease (Su et al. 2020). Symptoms of COVID-19 disease vary, including mild flu-like symptoms, pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and fatal outcome. Patients with cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, older adults, and even genetically predisposed individuals are at highest risk of COVID-19 severity (Sharma et al. 2020; Su et al. 2020; Wibawa 2021; Vakil et al. 2022). As per the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations, wearing masks, using antiviral drugs, social distancing, and adherence to vaccination procedures are crucial behaviors to control of COVID-19 pandemic around the world (Sharma et al. 2020). The scientific effort towards development of efficient vaccines against invasive pathogens dates back many years since long (Deb et al. 2020; Zhang et al. 2020; Wibawa 2021). These vaccine platforms have also been designed against pathogenic bacteria (Farhani et al. 2019; Jafari and Mahmoodi 2021). In this regard, developing an efficient, protective, and safe vaccine is considered as a pivotal preventive approach to hinder the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spread (Moore and Klasse 2020). Therefore, different pharmaceutical companies and research teams worldwide competed to present a safe and efficient vaccine against the COVID-19 for international community use. These efforts have developed other vaccine platforms to enter preclinical and clinical trials and some of them have been approved (Chen et al. 2021), including traditional vaccines such as live or inactivated, subunit, and nucleic acid-based vaccines as next-generation vaccines (Moore and Klasse 2020). Based on the scientific evidence, live-attenuated vaccines stimulate the innate, cellular, and humoral immune responses by inducing Toll-like Receptors (TLRs) with long-term immunity and may develop hypersensitivity. The main drawback of these vaccines is their costly safety and efficacy assessments. Inactivated viral vaccines poorly provoke cellular immune responses which mitigate their efficacy. In April 2020, an inactivated COVID-19 vaccine was manufactured by Sinovac and Wuhan Institute of Biological Products (Sinopharm) (Moore and Klasse 2020; Su et al. 2020). Subunit vaccines are safe, with some defects including low immunogenicity, booster or adjuvant requirement, and high cost (Koirala et al. 2020; Su et al. 2020). Nucleic acid-based vaccines have been developed based on sequence information. They include DNA or mRNA sequences of antigens that strongly stimulate cellular and humoral immune responses in various doses. Due to their advantages, such as fast production, and the earliest COVID-19 vaccines in clinical trials, a noticeable advantage of DNA-based vaccines is their stability in various storage conditions (Silveira et al. 2020; van Riel and de Wit 2020). RNA-based vaccines received more attention from pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer/Biontech and Moderna. In contrast to DNA vaccines, they stimulate effective humoral immune response as TLR ligand without adjuvant, and its sequence is modified to preclude mRNA degradation (Moore and Klasse 2020; van Riel and de Wit 2020; Soiza et al. 2021).

USER REQUEST:
I am writing a report about vaccines in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic. I am a PhD student and my focus is on the molecular aspects of vaccines. Can you give me a list of the different types of vaccines and their characteristics? Keep it brief, I don't want the response to exceed 300 words. I also want to know how Toll-like receptors are related to vaccines.","The document describes several types of vaccines and their characteristics in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. These include:

*   **Live-attenuated vaccines:** These stimulate innate, cellular, and humoral immune responses by inducing Toll-like Receptors (TLRs), leading to long-term immunity. However, they may develop hypersensitivity and require costly safety and efficacy assessments (Moore and Klasse 2020).
*   **Inactivated viral vaccines:** These poorly provoke cellular immune responses, which mitigates their efficacy. An inactivated COVID-19 vaccine was manufactured by Sinovac and Wuhan Institute of Biological Products (Sinopharm) in April 2020 (Moore and Klasse 2020; Su et al. 2020).
*   **Subunit vaccines:** While safe, they possess defects such as low immunogenicity, a requirement for boosters or adjuvants, and high cost (Koirala et al. 2020; Su et al. 2020).
*   **Nucleic acid-based vaccines:** These are developed based on sequence information, comprising DNA or mRNA sequences of antigens that strongly stimulate cellular and humoral immune responses (Moore and Klasse 2020).
    *   **DNA-based vaccines:** Noted for fast production, being among the earliest COVID-19 vaccines in clinical trials, and their stability in various storage conditions (Silveira et al. 2020; van Riel and de Wit 2020).
    *   **RNA-based vaccines:** Stimulate an effective humoral immune response as a TLR ligand without adjuvant, and their sequence is modified to preclude mRNA degradation (Moore and Klasse 2020; van Riel and de Wit 2020; Soiza et al. 2021).

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are related to vaccines in a few ways. Live-attenuated vaccines stimulate immune responses by inducing Toll-like Receptors (TLRs) (Moore and Klasse 2020). Additionally, RNA-based vaccines stimulate an effective humoral immune response as a TLR ligand (Moore and Klasse 2020; van Riel and de Wit 2020; Soiza et al. 2021).","Hello there! It's great you're focusing on the molecular aspects of vaccines for your report, especially given their critical role in the COVID-19 pandemic. Here’s a brief overview of the different vaccine types and their connection to Toll-like Receptors, as you requested:

### Types of Vaccines and Their Characteristics:

1.  **Live-attenuated Vaccines:** These vaccines use a weakened form of the virus. They are known to stimulate robust innate, cellular, and humoral immune responses, often leading to long-term immunity. A key mechanism involves inducing Toll-like Receptors (TLRs). However, their development requires extensive and costly safety and efficacy assessments, and there's a potential for hypersensitivity.
2.  **Inactivated Viral Vaccines:** These vaccines contain whole viruses that have been killed, meaning they cannot replicate or cause disease. While generally safe, they tend to provoke cellular immune responses less effectively, which can limit their overall efficacy. An inactivated COVID-19 vaccine was developed by Sinovac and Sinopharm.
3.  **Subunit Vaccines:** These vaccines use only specific components (subunits) of the pathogen, such as proteins, to stimulate an immune response. They are considered safe but often have low immunogenicity, meaning they might require booster shots or adjuvants to enhance the immune response, and can be costly to produce.
4.  **Nucleic Acid-Based Vaccines (Next-Generation):**
    *   **DNA Vaccines:** These deliver DNA sequences encoding specific antigens into host cells. They strongly stimulate both cellular and humoral immune responses. Advantages include fast production and remarkable stability under various storage conditions.
    *   **RNA Vaccines (mRNA Vaccines):** These provide mRNA sequences for antigens. They effectively stimulate a strong humoral immune response. A notable advantage is their ability to act as a Toll-like Receptor (TLR) ligand without needing an additional adjuvant. Their sequences are often modified to prevent mRNA degradation. Examples include the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines.

### Toll-like Receptors (TLRs) and Vaccines:

Toll-like Receptors are a crucial part of the innate immune system, acting as pattern recognition receptors that detect pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). In the context of vaccines:

*   **Stimulation:** Live-attenuated vaccines induce TLRs, which helps kickstart the innate immune response and contributes to the subsequent development of robust, long-term cellular and humoral immunity.
*   **Adjuvancy:** For RNA-based vaccines, the RNA itself can act as a TLR ligand, effectively serving as an internal adjuvant. This direct interaction with TLRs helps to stimulate a potent immune response without the need for external immune-enhancing substances.

Understanding how these different platforms interact with the immune system, particularly through molecular pathways like TLR activation, is central to developing more effective and safer vaccines!"

**Overview of Corporate Bonds**
The stock market crash of the late 2000s taught many investors a painful lesson about the importance of diversifying their investments. They remain committed to low- to moderate-risk investment vehicles that provide a compromise between security and return on investment.
Corporate bonds are one such vehicle. They can provide predictable interest payments for income-seeking investors at manageable risk levels. They occupy a middle ground between low-interest, low-risk government bonds and stocks, which may offer higher returns but are much riskier overall.
But corporate bonds are not perfect. Individual corporate bonds have significant drawbacks you should carefully consider before investing. 
What Is a Corporate Bond?
Both private and public companies sell corporate bonds to raise money for business operations. In exchange, they pay you interest on the amount you purchased.
Like other assets that pay interest, companies most often use corporate bonds to fund capital projects. This term encompasses just about any investment a company can make, such as:
•	Construction of a new warehouse or manufacturing facility
•	Purchasing or leasing new property
•	Purchasing or leasing new equipment
•	Buying inventory
They typically come in units that carry a face value of $1,000. Also known as “par value,” it’s the amount the company, known as the bond issuer, must pay the holder on the bond’s maturity date. Some bonds require investors to buy more than one unit, so they may have a minimum purchase amount, such as $3,000 or $5,000.
Corporate Bonds Structure
A corporate bond makes regular interest payments to its investors. It’s popular among income-seeking investors, from financial institutions looking to offset higher-risk investments to retirement investors trying to earn interest income over a set period.
Maturity Period & Call Date
Like a U.S. Treasury bond, a corporate bond has a specific maturity date. That’s the day you get the original amount of your investment back. Maturity terms on corporate bonds — the period between their issue date and maturity date — range from as short as one year to as long as 30 years. 
Corporate bonds with less than one year maturity periods are known as “corporate paper” or “short-term financing.” The most common investors in these bonds are likely to be larger financial entities, including banks, mutual funds, and hedge funds rather than individual investors. 
Many corporate bonds also have call dates. Call dates are the first date the issuing company can legally buy the bond back from investors if it no longer needs the money. 
Prospectus
Before it issues a new bond to the general public, the company must release a prospectus that outlines the intended use of the money. This requirement applies even to private companies not listed on any stock exchange. 
The prospectus describes the bond’s term, including its final maturity date and call date. It also outlines the bond’s initial interest rate and describes how and when the bond pays interest quarterly, semiannually, annually, or in a lump sum when the issuer buys the bond back. 
Finally, the prospectus outlines the bondholder’s right of repayment if the issuing company defaults or declares bankruptcy. It includes the order in which investors receive repayment based on their investor type, which depends on whether the bond is secured or unsecured.
Secured vs. Unsecured Corporate Bonds
Corporate bonds can be secured or unsecured. 
Secured bonds are guaranteed by some form of collateral, such as inventory, real property, or monetary assets. When a corporate bond issuer declares bankruptcy, secured bondholders have a legal right to seize the collateral. 
Unsecured bonds, also known as debentures, are only guaranteed by the company’s promise to repay. Unsecured bondholders have no right to seize property. In the event of bankruptcy, they may be forced to forfeit future interest payments as well as a significant fraction of their principal payments. 
Some bond types are always unsecured, such as convertible notes (which you can convert into shares of company stock). Others, such as fixed-rate and variable-rate bonds, may be either. You can find the bond’s secured status in the prospectus.
Because unsecured bonds are considered riskier for investors, they have higher interest rates than secured bonds. However, convertible bonds tend to come with lower interest rates because you can convert them into equity.
Corporate Bonds vs. Preferred Stocks
Corporate bonds share some features with preferred stock, such as regular payments to investors. These similarities are enough to create confusion for inexperienced investors. 
But there are some important differences between the two as well:
•	Debt vs. Equity. A corporate bond is a debt instrument that provides no ownership stake in its issuer. In contrast, a preferred stock is an equity vehicle that does confer ownership in the underlying company. 
•	Liquidity. You can trade both corporate bonds and preferred stock on secondary markets. But preferred stock often trades on stock exchanges, increasing the potential market size and making it easier for investors to buy and sell them.
•	Repayment Order. In bankruptcy, preferred stockholders are entitled to repayment before common stockholders but after corporate bondholders.
•	Exchange for Common Stock. You can exchange convertible corporate bonds for the issuers’ common shares under certain circumstances. Otherwise, it’s difficult or impossible for bondholders to exchange their holdings for stock. In contrast, you can always exchange preferred stocks for common stocks at an agreed-upon ratio.
Types of Corporate Bonds
Corporate bonds come in several different forms. A given bond can fall into more than one of these categories.
Fixed-Rate Bonds
This type of bond carries a fixed interest rate for its entire life. The rate is determined by its issuer’s credit rating on the bond’s issue date. Companies with higher credit ratings pay lower interest rates on their bonds, while companies with lower credit ratings pay higher interest rates.
Fixed-rate bonds typically make semiannual interest payments. They’re currently the most common type of corporate bond.
Variable-Rate Bonds
Variable-rate bonds’ interest rates change in response to fluctuations in long-term benchmark rates, with most bonds changing once per year. Their yield is generally determined by the company’s credit rating on the date of each interest payment.
Floating-Rate Bonds
Floating-rate bonds’ interest rates fluctuate with market benchmarks like Libor or the Federal Reserve’s federal funds rate and the company’s credit rating on the date of each readjustment. Unlike variable-rate bonds’ annual readjustments, changes in floating-rate bond rates usually occur after each quarterly interest payment.
Zero-Coupon Bonds
Zero-coupon bonds don’t pay interest. Instead, they trade at deep discounts to par value (face value). At maturity, the investor can redeem their zero-coupon bond for par value, realizing a profit over what they originally paid. 
Callable Bonds
Issuers of callable bonds have the right to buy them back after an initial lockup period ends but before maturity. The first date the issuer can buy back the bond is known as the call date. 
The buyback is always voluntary. For example, a company that issues a callable bond with a final maturity date of Jan. 31, 2030, and a call date of Jan. 31, 2024, can buy it back after the earlier of the two dates, but it doesn’t have to. 
If a bond is called, its issuer typically pays par value and any unpaid accrued interest. Callable bonds can have fixed, variable, or floating rates.
A company may call bonds for various reasons. But most often, it’s because prevailing interest rates have fallen and the issuer’s credit allows it to secure lower rates on new debt issues. 
Since called bonds are usually replaced with lower-yield bonds, an investor whose bond is called may have to settle for lower yields on future bond purchases that offer comparable levels of risk. They also miss out on future interest payments on the called bond. Both factors reduce their overall yield.
Putable Bond 
Putable bonds, also called put bonds or retractable bonds, are the reverse of callable bonds. After a set date, holders of putable bonds are entitled to ask the issuer for repayment of their principal plus all accumulated interest. 
It often occurs when a bondholder dies. Heirs of deceased bondholders may have a “survivor’s option” that entitles them to sell inherited bonds back to their issuers.
Bondholders may also exercise the put in inflationary environments. As prevailing interest rates rise, bonds with lower interest rates become less attractive, and their market value falls. It makes sense for bondholders to exercise the put sooner rather than later and use the proceeds to invest in bonds paying higher rates.
Because they give bondholders the right to early repayment, put bonds are less risky, more attractive investments. They typically have lower interest rates as a result.
Convertible
You can convert a convertible bond into a set amount of its issuer’s common stock. It allows a company’s creditor to secure an actual equity stake in it. 
Like callable and putable bonds, convertible bonds come with restrictions on how and when you can convert to stock. They’re also more susceptible to issuers’ stock price fluctuations than other types of bonds.
Corporate Bond Ratings
Every corporate bond is rated by at least one of the major U.S. rating agencies — Fitch, Standard & Poor’s, or Moody’s. Each agency has its own letter-grade scale, but the most important distinction is between the two broad risk categories: investment grade and noninvestment grade. 
Noninvestment-grade bonds are popularly known as “junk,” as in “junk bonds.” In more polite circles, they’re known as “high-yield bonds.” On S&P’s scale, which is the most commonly used measurement in the United States, all bonds rated below BBB- are considered noninvestment grade. 
A bond’s yield is inversely proportional to its issuer’s credit rating. The higher the rating, the lower the yield. 
Lower-rated bonds come with a higher risk of default. However, they also have high interest rates — far higher than investors could get in a savings account or CD. That’s worth the risk to some people.
Corporate bondholders do enjoy greater security than stockholders. Whereas a publicly traded company may suspend dividends on common or preferred stock at any time, any company that issues a corporate bond has a legal obligation to issue regular interest payments. The only ways out of it are to default on its bonds or declare bankruptcy.

    *   In the event of a company's bankruptcy, **corporate bondholders** are legally entitled to repayment *before* preferred stockholders.
    *   **Preferred stockholders** are entitled to repayment *before* common stockholders, but *after* corporate bondholders. This places bondholders in a more secure position.

4.  **Exchange for Common Stock:**
    *   While some **convertible corporate bonds** can be exchanged for the issuer's common shares under specific circumstances, it's generally difficult or impossible for other types of bondholders to convert their holdings into stock.

Is the Indian Child Welfare Act
Constitutional?

In Brackeen v. Zinke, a federal district court declared that the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA)—a 1978
law meant “to protect the best interests of Indian children and to promote the stability and security of
Indian tribes and families”—was unconstitutional in several ways. This decision is currently pending
before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (Fifth Circuit), and its practical implications have
been paused until the appeal is decided. If upheld, this decision would eliminate many of the special rules
that apply to the adoption and foster care placements of Indian children in the three states involved in this
case: Texas, Louisiana, and Indiana. Among other things, these rules allow a tribe to assume jurisdiction
over, or otherwise to have input into, the placements of children who are eligible for tribal membership.
In 1978, Congress recognized that an “alarmingly high percentage of Indian families” were being broken
up by often-unwarranted removal of their children by nontribal entities, placing many of these children in
non-Indian foster and adoptive homes. Citing its responsibility for protecting and preserving Indian tribes,
Congressional Research Service
https://crsreports.congress.gov
LSB10245
Congressional Research Service 2
Congress passed ICWA to protect Indian children as vital to the tribes’ continued existence. ICWA is
designed to do two primary things: (1) set standards for placing Indian children with foster or adoptive
families, and (2) help tribes set up child and family programs. Though a number of lawsuits have
challenged ICWA over the past 40 years, including on the grounds that the statute impermissibly treated
Indian children differently on the basis of race, until Brackeen, none of those challenges had been
successful.
Instead, courts in prior cases had noted Congress’s “plenary” authority over Indian affairs—derived
principally from the Indian Commerce Clause and the Treaty Power—and concluded that applying special
rules to Indian children was constitutional because, among other things, the distinction between Indians
and non-Indians was not an impermissible race-based classification, but was instead a recognition of the
unique political status of Indian tribes.
This Sidebar gives a brief overview of ICWA, outlines the Brackeen court’s decision with relevant legal
context, and explores the possible impacts, including potential for higher court and congressional action.
Relevant ICWA provisions and associated regulations
Most relevant to the claims at issue in Brackeen, ICWA sets forth a series of duties that must be fulfilled
for Indian child placements. For the purposes of ICWA, an “Indian child” is any unmarried person under
eighteen who is either a member of an Indian tribe or is both eligible for membership in an Indian tribe
and the biological child of a member of an Indian tribe.
Three main aspects of ICWA are relevant to the issues raised in Brackeen. First, under ICWA, any party
seeking involuntary termination of parental rights to an Indian child under state law must first
demonstrate that active efforts have been made to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs
designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family. Second, involuntary termination requires evidence
beyond a reasonable doubt (including expert witness testimony), that the continued custody of the child
by the parent or Indian custodian would likely result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child.
Third, when an Indian child is placed with a foster or adoptive family under state law, ICWA lists general
preferences for that placement: (1) a member of the child’s extended family; (2) other members of the
Indian child’s tribe; or (3) other Indian families. However, if a tribe wants to re-order those preferences
for Indian children associated with that tribe, it may pass a resolution doing so, and state agencies and
courts generally must follow that amended order of preference. In any event, ICWA provides that these
preferences may be circumvented in an individual case upon a showing of “good cause.”
The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) has authority to make regulations governing ICWA’s implementation.
Though BIA chose not to do so when the statute was first passed, in 2016 it issued a Final Rule aimed at
reconciling different states’ interpretations of ICWA—for example, by clarifying the circumstances in
which “good cause” exists for circumventing ICWA’s placement preferences.
Brackeen v. Zinke: the plaintiffs’ claims and the district court’s decision
A group of plaintiffs comprising three states (Indiana, Louisiana, and Texas) and several private parties—
primarily non-Indian couples who had adopted or wanted to adopt an Indian child—challenged several
facets of ICWA and related regulations (including the 2016 Final Rule, as well as certain funding
provisions conditioned on ICWA compliance), seeking to have them declared unconstitutional or
otherwise rendered invalid. They filed these challenges in the United States District Court for the
Northern District of Texas, where Judge Reed O’Connor did declare much of ICWA unconstitutional,
granting nearly all of the plaintiffs’ claims. (This decision is arguably the second-most consequential
decision by Judge O’Connor in recent months, as he ruled in December 2018 that the Affordable Care Act
was also unconstitutional). The federal defendants, intervening tribes, and a group of amicus curiae
Congressional Research Service 3
including numerous federally recognized tribes, several Indian organizations, and a number of states,
disputed plaintiffs’ characterization of ICWA and contended the challenged laws and implementing
regulations were lawful.
The plaintiffs’ claims about ICWA’s validity, and the court’s responses to them, are discussed below.
Equal protection: does ICWA use a race-based classification, and if so, can it survive
strict scrutiny?
The state and the individual plaintiffs together claimed that ICWA ran afoul of the Fifth Amendment’s
equal protection guarantees, by impermissibly using a race-based classification.
The plaintiffs’ claim relied primarily on the Supreme Court’s decisions in two cases. First, in Adarand
Constructors v. Peña, the Supreme Court established that any time the federal government subjects
individuals to unequal treatment based on their race, that action is subject to “strict scrutiny”—a test that
asks whether the classification (1) serves a compelling government interest and (2) is narrowly tailored to
further that interest. Second, in Rice v. Cayetano, in the course of invalidating a Hawaiian law that
permitted only persons of native Hawaiian descent to vote in certain elections, the Supreme Court
recognized that “[a]ncestry can be a proxy for race” and may be subject to the same constitutional
limitations as directly race-based classifications. The plaintiffs in Brackeen argued that ICWA involved a
race-based classification because its definition of Indian children was based on the children’s ancestry,
rather than strictly on membership in a federally recognized tribe. Plaintiffs alleged that this classification
neither served any compelling interest, nor was narrowly tailored.
The federal defendants, intervening tribes, and several amici disputed plaintiffs’ characterization of ICWA
as a race-based classification. In particular, they emphasized longstanding Supreme Court jurisprudence
holding that the federal government’s relationship with federally recognized Indian tribes is based on a
political, rather than racial categorization. For example, in Morton v. Mancari, the Court upheld BIA’s
employment preference for members of federally recognized tribes because the preference was a political
classification—it singled out members of tribal entities who have a unique relationship with the federal
government—rather than a racial one. The Supreme Court further opined that because “[l]iterally every
piece of legislation dealing with Indian tribes” is “explicitly designed to help only Indians,” deeming such
legislation racial discrimination would jeopardize “the solemn commitment of the Government toward the
Indians.”
Because the federal defendants relied on the argument that ICWA’s distinctions were political rather than
racial in nature, they proffered no arguments on whether ICWA would withstand the strict scrutiny that
would be applied if it were a race-based classification. However, they asked that the court permit
additional briefing in the event strict scrutiny applied—a request that the court denied.
The district court, however, agreed with the plaintiffs that the definition of Indian children was race-based
rather than political. In doing so, the court concluded that this case was more like Rice than like Mancari,
because Mancari involved only tribe members rather than Indians eligible for tribal membership. The
court then decided—in the absence of any counterarguments from the government—that the race-based
classification was not narrowly tailored, even assuming that it served a compelling interest.
Nondelegation: does ICWA impermissibly delegate legislative power to tribes?
The state plaintiffs argued that giving the tribes power to reorder ICWA’s placement preferences violated
the nondelegation doctrine, which generally prohibits Congress from delegating its core legislative
powers, whether to other government entities or to private parties. Courts generally use the “intelligible
principle” test to assess whether a congressional delegation of legislative power to governmental entities
is permissible. This is a forgiving standard; the Supreme Court has not invalidated a statute on these
Congressional Research Service 4
grounds since 1935. However, some have also read the Court’s jurisprudence as prohibiting Congress
from delegating its powers to private entities outside the government.
Here, the district court relied upon both these understandings of the nondelegation doctrine to conclude
that ICWA was invalid. First, the court held that Congress had not delineated a clear legal framework to
guide how the delegated authority under ICWA would be implemented. Instead, the district court agreed
with plaintiffs that the Indian tribes’ authority to reorder adoption placement preferences under ICWA was
an essentially legislative authority that could not be delegated. Moreover, the court decided that even if
that power could be delegated in some circumstances, Indian tribes were akin to private entities that could
not exercise delegated powers. The district court was not receptive to arguments that Indian tribes are
fundamentally distinct from other private parties (such as corporations), and should thus be treated
differently in nondelegation analysis.
Anti-commandeering: does ICWA infringe on state sovereignty over child custody
matters, forcing the state to perform federal regulatory functions?
The state plaintiffs claimed ICWA violated the anti-commandeering doctrine, rooted in the Constitution’s
allocation of powers between the federal government and the states, which prohibits Congress from
forcing state political branches to perform regulatory functions on the federal government’s behalf. The
court granted this claim, agreeing that ICWA requires state courts and executive agencies to apply federal
standards and directives to policy areas that are normally reserved for non-federal jurisdiction, such as
adoptions, foster care policies, and other child custody issues. The district court tersely rejected the
federal government’s argument that ICWA is instead an exercise of Congress’s “plenary and exclusive”
authority over Indian tribes.
Agency rulemaking: did a 2016 regulation violate the APA?
The plaintiffs also used the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) to challenge the BIA’s 2016 Final Rule.
The challenged rule tried to establish uniformity in ICWA’s application by, among other things, clarifying
the “good cause” requirement for circumventing ICWA’s placement preferences for Indian children.
The district court took a two-pronged approach to plaintiffs’ claims that BIA’s regulation was
impermissible under the APA. First, the court announced that any regulation implementing the newly
invalid portions of ICWA (i.e., the parts of ICWA that the court had already declared unconstitutional)
should be struck down. The court then held in the alternative that the regulation exceeded the scope of
BIA’s statutory regulatory authority—in the court’s view, the regulation “clarified” a provision that was
not ambiguous and needed no clarification. Because the district court viewed the underlying provision as
unambiguous, it gave no deference to the agency’s determination that the regulation was necessary.
Remaining claims: Indian Commerce Clause and due process
The court purported to grant plaintiffs’ claim that ICWA itself exceeded Congress’s legislative powers
under the Indian Commerce Clause, but did so as an extension of its ruling that ICWA violated the anticommandeering doctrine, as Congress’s exercise of its power over Indian commerce cannot be employed
to commandeer the states.
Finally, the court denied the individual plaintiffs’ substantive due process claims, premised on ICWA
allegedly infringing upon their fundamental rights of custody and family togetherness as foster or wouldbe adoptive parents of Indian children. The district court observed that the Supreme Court has not applied
the fundamental rights of custody and of keeping families together to foster families, and the district court
declined to extend recognition of such rights to the individual plaintiffs challenging ICWA.

Additional Context
Similar challenges to ICWA have been brought over the years. At least one advocacy group has made
challenging ICWA part of its core mission, claiming that Native American children are being harmed
because ICWA hinders the ability of (non-Native) persons to adopt them. By contrast, ICWA’s supporters
fear that challengers are jeopardizing longstanding principles underlying tribal sovereignty, while
“[c]loaking [their] efforts in the language of civil rights.” Until Brackeen, however, direct challenges to
ICWA generally had been unsuccessful—with perhaps one limited, but notable, exception.
In a 2013 case, Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl (popularly known as the Baby Veronica case), the U.S.
Supreme Court limited the range of circumstances in which ICWA might apply. In a 5-4 decision, the
Court ruled that several of ICWA’s provisions were inapplicable if the parent seeking to invoke them
never had legal or physical custody of the Indian child. In the Baby Veronica case, that meant that the
Indian father—who had never had custody of his daughter—could not invoke his and his tribe’s rights
under ICWA to block her adoption. Second, the Court stated that the ICWA’s placement preferences for
an Indian child adoption were relevant only if multiple parties actually sought to adopt the Indian child. In
the Baby Veronica case, because only one party—a non-Indian couple—was trying to adopt the child,
ICWA’s placement preferences could not prevent the adoption from being finalized.
The Baby Veronica case was only the second ICWA case heard by the Supreme Court. The first came
more than twenty years earlier, in 1989, when the Supreme Court held that, for ICWA purposes, the
domicile of an Indian child was the domicile of the parents, regardless of where the child was actually
born. The Baby Veronica case thus seemed to signal to some that ICWA was newly ripe for challenges,
but the Supreme Court has so far declined to hear other cases challenging ICWA.
However, many challenges like Brackeen have been raised in federal or state courts. As one example, the
United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit recently dismissed a challenge to ICWA’s
constitutionality, holding that it was mooted by the fact that the would-be adoptive parents had been able
to complete their adoptions. In Brackeen v. Zinke, however, Judge O’Connor denied a motion to dismiss
on similar grounds.
What’s Next?
The Brackeen v. Zinke decision has already been appealed to the Fifth Circuit. By stipulation of the
parties, briefing in the appeal has been expedited and is scheduled to be completed in February 2019; the
case is tentatively calendared for oral argument in March 2019. Although Judge O’Connor declined to
stay the effect of his ruling pending appeal, the Fifth Circuit granted just such a stay despite the plaintiffs’
objection, so at least for now, the district court decision will not change the way ICWA is administered in
Texas, Louisiana, or Indiana. In the event the Fifth Circuit agrees that ICWA is unconstitutional on one or
more grounds, the adversely affected parties would likely seek appeal to the United States Supreme
Court.
The federal defendants filed their brief in January, arguing that each aspect of the district court’s decision
was “unprecedented and in conflict with binding authority.” The brief also renewed challenges to the
plaintiffs’ standing and argued that ICWA’s severability clause meant the ruling should have been
narrower in any case. With regard to the equal protection claim, the government previewed the argument
it would have made in supplemental briefing below: ICWA protects tribe members and their families,
which includes the not-yet-enrolled children of tribal members, and is narrowly tailored to protect the best
interests of those children. Nonetheless, the government suggested that if the Fifth Circuit agreed that
strict scrutiny applied, it should remand to the district court for full briefing on the issue.
In addition to ruling on the merits of the constitutional challenge to ICWA, the Fifth Circuit’s decision
might also provide an opportunity for an appellate court to elaborate further on many of the

LSB10245 · VERSION 5 · UPDATED
constitutional issues discussed, oftentimes in succinct terms, by the district court in Brackeen. The
relationship between the Supreme Court’s jurisprudence on equal protection and tribal issues has
prompted extensive legal commentary, and some have questioned what, if any, relevance the Brackeen
decision might have for other Indian law statutes. The significance of these issues might make the
Brackeen decision, to the extent it is upheld by the Fifth Circuit, particularly ripe for Supreme Court
resolution.


USER REQUEST:
Summarize the arguments that support and oppose the claim that the ICWA is unconstitutional.","Arguments supporting the claim that the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) is unconstitutional include:

*   **Equal Protection Clause Violation:** Plaintiffs argued that ICWA's definition of ""Indian child,"" based on ancestry or eligibility for tribal membership, is an impermissible race-based classification that violates the Fifth Amendment’s equal protection guarantees (Brackeen v. Zinke). They contended this classification does not serve a compelling government interest and is not narrowly tailored, citing *Adarand Constructors v. Peña* and *Rice v. Cayetano* (Brackeen v. Zinke). The district court agreed, concluding the definition was race-based and not narrowly tailored (Brackeen v. Zinke).
*   **Nondelegation Doctrine Violation:** State plaintiffs argued that Congress impermissibly delegated its legislative power to tribes by allowing them to reorder ICWA's placement preferences, violating the nondelegation doctrine (Brackeen v. Zinke). The district court agreed, finding that Congress did not provide a clear legal framework for this delegated authority and that Indian tribes were akin to private entities to whom legislative powers cannot be delegated (Brackeen v. Zinke).
*   **Anti-Commandeering Doctrine Violation:** State plaintiffs claimed ICWA violated the anti-commandeering doctrine by forcing state courts and executive agencies to apply federal standards and directives in child custody matters, which are traditionally state-reserved policy areas (Brackeen v. Zinke). The district court granted this claim (Brackeen v. Zinke).
*   **Administrative Procedure Act (APA) Violation:** Plaintiffs challenged the Bureau of Indian Affairs' (BIA) 2016 Final Rule, arguing it was impermissible under the APA (Brackeen v. Zinke). The district court found the regulation should be struck down for implementing newly invalidated portions of ICWA and, alternatively, for exceeding the BIA's statutory authority by clarifying an unambiguous provision (Brackeen v. Zinke).
*   **Exceeding Indian Commerce Clause Powers:** The court purported to grant plaintiffs' claim that ICWA exceeded Congress's legislative powers under the Indian Commerce Clause, tying this to its anti-commandeering ruling (Brackeen v. Zinke).

Arguments opposing the claim that ICWA is unconstitutional include:

*   **Political, Not Racial, Classification:** Federal defendants, intervening tribes, and amici disputed the characterization of ICWA as race-based, emphasizing longstanding Supreme Court jurisprudence (e.g., *Morton v. Mancari*) that the federal government's relationship with federally recognized Indian tribes is political, not racial (Brackeen v. Zinke). They argued that legislation designed to help Indians protects members of tribal entities with a unique relationship with the federal government, and deeming such legislation racial discrimination would jeopardize the government's commitment to Indians (Brackeen v. Zinke). In the appeal, the government argued ICWA protects tribe members and their families (including not-yet-enrolled children of tribal members) and is narrowly tailored to their best interests (Brackeen v. Zinke).
*   **Congress's Plenary Authority:** Courts in prior cases had noted Congress’s “plenary” authority over Indian affairs, derived from the Indian Commerce Clause and Treaty Power, and concluded that applying special rules to Indian children was constitutional because the distinction was based on the unique political status of Indian tribes, not race (Brackeen v. Zinke). The federal government also argued that ICWA is an exercise of Congress’s “plenary and exclusive” authority over Indian tribes (Brackeen v. Zinke).
*   **Indian Tribes are Distinct Entities:** Although not accepted by the district court, arguments were made that Indian tribes are fundamentally distinct from other private parties and should be treated differently in nondelegation analysis (Brackeen v. Zinke).
*   **Precedent of Unsuccessful Challenges:** Until *Brackeen*, challenges to ICWA on grounds of impermissible race-based treatment had generally been unsuccessful (Brackeen v. Zinke). The federal defendants in the appeal argued the district court's decision was ""unprecedented and in conflict with binding authority"" (Brackeen v. Zinke).","The question of whether the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) is constitutional is a complex one, with strong arguments from both sides, as highlighted by the *Brackeen v. Zinke* case.

Here's a summary of the arguments supporting and opposing the claim that ICWA is unconstitutional:

### Arguments Supporting ICWA's Constitutionality (Defending ICWA)

Those who argue that ICWA is constitutional, including federal defendants, intervening tribes, and several amici, generally rely on the following points:

1.  **Political, Not Racial, Classification (Equal Protection):**
    *   They contend that the federal government's relationship with federally recognized Indian tribes is based on a **political** categorization, not a racial one. This unique political status derives from historical treaties and the tribes' inherent sovereignty.
    *   Previous Supreme Court cases, such as *Morton v. Mancari*, have upheld distinctions for tribal members as political classifications, not subject to the same strict scrutiny as race-based classifications.
    *   ICWA, by defining ""Indian child"" to include those eligible for tribal membership or children of tribal members, aims to protect tribal entities and their continued existence, which is a political goal.
    *   The government argues that ICWA protects tribe members and their families, including children not yet formally enrolled, and is narrowly tailored to protect the best interests of these children and tribes.

2.  **Congressional Plenary Authority Over Indian Affairs:**
    *   Congress has ""plenary"" (exclusive and comprehensive) authority over Indian affairs, derived primarily from the Indian Commerce Clause and the Treaty Power in the Constitution.
    *   This broad authority allows Congress to enact special legislation, like ICWA, to fulfill its trust responsibility to protect and preserve Indian tribes and their members.
    *   Historically, courts have noted this plenary power as a basis for upholding prior challenges to ICWA.

3.  **Protection of Tribal Sovereignty and Children's Best Interests:**
    *   ICWA was passed in 1978 to address the ""alarmingly high percentage of Indian families"" being broken up by unwarranted removals of children by non-tribal entities, threatening the continued existence of tribes.
    *   It aims to protect the best interests of Indian children by keeping them connected to their cultural heritage and tribes, and to promote the stability and security of Indian tribes and families.
    *   ICWA's provisions, such as active efforts to prevent family breakup, higher evidentiary standards for termination, and placement preferences, are designed to serve these critical governmental interests.

4.  **Tribes as Unique Governmental Entities (Nondelegation):**
    *   Arguments against nondelegation by the defendants would assert that Indian tribes are not akin to ""private entities"" but are distinct sovereign governments with whom the federal government has a unique relationship.
    *   Therefore, delegating authority to tribes, such as the power to reorder placement preferences, is permissible under the nondelegation doctrine, especially given Congress's plenary power over Indian affairs.

5.  **Valid Exercise of Agency Authority (APA):**
    *   The Bureau of Indian Affairs' (BIA) 2016 Final Rule was a legitimate exercise of its authority to implement ICWA uniformly across states, particularly by clarifying ambiguous provisions like ""good cause"" for placement preference exceptions.

### Arguments Opposing ICWA's Constitutionality (Challenging ICWA)

Plaintiffs, including several states (Texas, Louisiana, Indiana) and non-Indian couples, argue that ICWA is unconstitutional on several grounds:

1.  **Race-Based Classification (Equal Protection):**
    *   They claim that ICWA impermissibly uses a **race-based classification** because its definition of an ""Indian child"" is based on ancestry (being eligible for tribal membership or being the biological child of a tribal member), rather than strictly on current membership in a federally recognized tribe.
    *   Citing Supreme Court cases like *Adarand Constructors v. Peña* and *Rice v. Cayetano*, they argue that such classifications are subject to ""strict scrutiny,"" requiring a compelling government interest and narrow tailoring.
    *   The district court in *Brackeen* agreed, finding that ICWA's definition was more like *Rice* (where ancestry was a proxy for race) than *Morton v. Mancari* (which involved only tribe members), and that the classification was not narrowly tailored.

2.  **Impermissible Delegation of Legislative Power (Nondelegation):**
    *   Plaintiffs contend that Congress impermissibly delegated its core legislative powers to Indian tribes, specifically the authority to reorder ICWA's child placement preferences.
    *   They argue that this violates the nondelegation doctrine because Congress did not provide a clear legal framework for how this authority should be implemented.
    *   Furthermore, they assert that Indian tribes should be viewed as private entities for nondelegation purposes, to whom Congress cannot delegate such legislative power. The district court agreed with this assessment.

3.  **Commandeering of State Governments (Anti-Commandeering Doctrine):**
    *   Plaintiffs claim that ICWA violates the anti-commandeering doctrine, which prohibits Congress from forcing state political branches (including state courts and executive agencies) to perform federal regulatory functions.
    *   They argue that ICWA requires states to apply federal standards and directives in policy areas traditionally reserved for state jurisdiction, such as child adoptions, foster care, and other child custody matters, thus infringing on state sovereignty. The district court upheld this claim.

4.  **Exceeding Congressional Power Under the Indian Commerce Clause:**
    *   Plaintiffs argue that even under the Indian Commerce Clause, Congress's power does not extend to commandeering states to implement federal policy.
    *   The district court largely aligned this claim with its anti-commandeering ruling, stating that Congress's power over Indian commerce cannot be used to force states into action.

5.  **Violation of Administrative Procedure Act (APA) for BIA Regulations:**
    *   Plaintiffs challenged the BIA's 2016 Final Rule, arguing it was unlawful.
    *   The district court agreed, ruling that the regulation implemented parts of ICWA it had already declared unconstitutional. Alternatively, the court found the regulation exceeded BIA's statutory authority by attempting to ""clarify"" a provision it deemed unambiguous, giving no deference to the agency.

6.  **Infringement on Fundamental Parental Rights (Substantive Due Process):**
    *   Individual plaintiffs (non-Indian foster or prospective adoptive parents) argued that ICWA infringed upon their fundamental rights of custody and family togetherness.
    *   However, the district court denied this claim, noting that the Supreme Court has not extended these fundamental rights to foster families.

It's important to remember that while the district court in *Brackeen v. Zinke* largely sided with the plaintiffs, declaring much of ICWA unconstitutional, this decision has been stayed and is currently under appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. The final resolution of these arguments could eventually reach the U.S. Supreme Court, significantly impacting federal Indian law and child welfare practices."

NetChoice’s Challenge to Florida’s S.B. 7072
Florida’s S.B. 7072 imposes restrictions on any information service, system, internet search engine, or
access software provider that enables access by multiple users to a computer server, is organized as a legal
entity, does business in Florida, and satisfies certain specified user- or revenue-based thresholds. Thus,
while the litigation about the law emphasized the limitations it imposed on social media platforms, the
law applied more broadly. NetChoice challenged restrictions that generally fall into two categories:
content moderation restrictions and individualized-explanation requirements.
The Supreme Court’s analysis in Moody focused on the content moderation restrictions. Those provisions
limit the ability of covered platforms to delete content, make content less visible to other users, or ban
users. Under S.B. 7072, platforms may not “deplatform” a political candidate or deprioritize a candidate’s
or “journalistic enterprise’s” posts. They must “apply censorship, deplatforming, and shadow banning
standards in a consistent manner,” and they cannot change the rules or terms that apply to users more than
once every 30 days. Deplatforming occurs when a platform bans a user for at least 14 days. Shadow
banning occurs when a platform deletes a user’s content or makes the account’s content less visible to
other users.
Before S.B. 7072 took effect, NetChoice sued, alleging that the content moderation provisions, on their
face, violate the First Amendment. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed a
preliminary injunction barring enforcement of the content moderation provisions while NetChoice’s
challenge is litigated. The court held that the provisions likely “trigger[] First Amendment scrutiny
because [S.B. 7072] restricts social-media platforms’ exercise of editorial judgment.” It decided that the
challenged provisions likely fail constitutional scrutiny because they lack a “substantial or compelling
interest that would justify [the provisions’] significant restrictions on platforms’ editorial judgment.”
NetChoice’s Challenge to Texas’s H.B. 20
Texas’s H.B. 20 applies to social media platforms with more than 50 million monthly active users in the
United States. The law defines social media platforms as public websites or applications that enable users
to create accounts and communicate for the primary purpose of posting user-generated information.
Internet service providers, email providers, and websites “that consist primarily of news, sports,
entertainment, or other” content that is not user generated are excluded from the definition.
As with Florida’s law, H.B. 20 limits when covered platforms may delete or restrict access to user-posted
content. Subject to enumerated exceptions, covered platforms are prohibited from censoring a user’s
content based on viewpoint or the user’s geographic location in Texas. Censor is defined to mean
“block[ing], ban[ning], remove[ing], deplatform[ing], demonetiz[ing], de-boost[ing], restrict[ing],
deny[ing] equal access or visibility to, or otherwise discriminat[ing] against expression.”
Again, NetChoice challenged H.B. 20’s content moderation provisions on their face and asked a court to
enjoin their enforcement before the law took effect. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit denied
the request. Expressly disagreeing with the Eleventh Circuit’s reasoning about Florida’s law, the Fifth
Circuit held that Texas’s content moderation provisions do not likely implicate First Amendment rights.
According to the Fifth Circuit, NetChoice was seeking to assert a “right to censor what people say” that is
not protected by the First Amendment. In the alternative, the court held that, even if the law restricted
protected expression, it is a content- and viewpoint-neutral law—so subject to intermediate scrutiny—and
Texas’s interest in protecting the free exchange of ideas is sufficiently important to satisfy that standard.

USER REQUEST:
Summarize NetChoice’s two challenges. Explain why they challenged the restrictions. Bold the major actors names and also any legislative references that are included in the text.","**NetChoice** challenged restrictions in **Florida’s S.B. 7072** and **Texas’s H.B. 20**.

**NetChoice’s** challenge to **Florida’s S.B. 7072** targeted restrictions on content moderation and individualized-explanation requirements, with the litigation emphasizing limitations on social media platforms (NetChoice’s Challenge to Florida’s S.B. 7072). **S.B. 7072** limits the ability of covered platforms to delete content, make content less visible, or ban users, specifically prohibiting ""deplatforming"" a political candidate or deprioritizing a candidate’s or ""journalistic enterprise’s"" posts (NetChoice’s Challenge to Florida’s S.B. 7072). It also requires consistent application of ""censorship, deplatforming, and shadow banning standards"" and restricts changing rules more than once every 30 days (NetChoice’s Challenge to Florida’s S.B. 7072). **NetChoice** sued, alleging these content moderation provisions violate the First Amendment (NetChoice’s Challenge to Florida’s S.B. 7072). The **U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit** affirmed a preliminary injunction, finding the provisions likely ""trigger[] First Amendment scrutiny"" because they ""restrict[] social-media platforms’ exercise of editorial judgment"" and likely fail constitutional scrutiny due to a lack of a ""substantial or compelling interest"" (NetChoice’s Challenge to Florida’s S.B. 7072).

For **Texas’s H.B. 20**, **NetChoice** challenged provisions that limit when covered social media platforms can delete or restrict access to user-posted content (NetChoice’s Challenge to Texas’s H.B. 20). **H.B. 20** prohibits platforms from censoring user content based on viewpoint or geographic location in Texas (NetChoice’s Challenge to Texas’s H.B. 20). **NetChoice** challenged these content moderation provisions on their face, seeking to enjoin their enforcement (NetChoice’s Challenge to Texas’s H.B. 20). The **U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit** denied the request, holding that **H.B. 20**’s content moderation provisions do not likely implicate First Amendment rights, characterizing **NetChoice**’s claim as asserting a ""right to censor what people say"" (NetChoice’s Challenge to Texas’s H.B. 20). Alternatively, the court held that even if the law restricted protected expression, it is a content- and viewpoint-neutral law, and Texas’s interest in protecting the free exchange of ideas is sufficiently important (NetChoice’s Challenge to Texas’s H.B. 20).","**NetChoice** has brought two significant legal challenges against state laws in **Florida** and **Texas**, both aimed at restricting how social media platforms moderate content. Essentially, **NetChoice** argues that these state laws infringe upon platforms' **First Amendment** rights to exercise editorial judgment over the content hosted on their sites.

Here's a breakdown of each challenge and why they were initiated:

1.  **Challenge to Florida’s S.B. 7072:**
    *   **What the law does:** **Florida’s S.B. 7072** broadly targets information services, including social media platforms, that meet specific user or revenue thresholds. Its content moderation restrictions limit platforms' ability to delete content, make it less visible (known as ""shadow banning""), or ban users entirely (""deplatforming""). The law specifically prohibits deplatforming political candidates and deprioritizing posts from candidates or ""journalistic enterprises."" It also requires platforms to apply censorship standards consistently and restricts them from changing their rules more frequently than once every 30 days.
    *   **Why **NetChoice** challenged it:** **NetChoice** sued before the law took effect, arguing that these content moderation provisions directly violate the **First Amendment**. They contend that platforms, much like traditional publishers, have a constitutional right to decide what content appears on their services. The **U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit** sided with **NetChoice** on a preliminary injunction, agreeing that **S.B. 7072** likely triggers **First Amendment** scrutiny because it restricts platforms' editorial judgment without a sufficiently ""substantial or compelling interest"" from the state.

2.  **Challenge to Texas’s H.B. 20:**
    *   **What the law does:** **Texas’s H.B. 20** specifically applies to social media platforms with over 50 million monthly active users in the United States, defining them as public websites where users create accounts to post user-generated information (excluding certain news or entertainment sites). This law also limits platforms' ability to delete or restrict access to user-posted content. It broadly prohibits ""censoring"" user content based on viewpoint or the user's geographic location within Texas. The term ""censor"" is defined very widely to include blocking, banning, removing, deplatforming, demonetizing, de-boosting, restricting, or otherwise discriminating against expression.
    *   **Why **NetChoice** challenged it:** Similar to the **Florida** case, **NetChoice** challenged the content moderation provisions of **H.B. 20** on **First Amendment** grounds, seeking to prevent its enforcement. However, in a contrasting decision, the **U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit** denied **NetChoice's** request. The **Fifth Circuit** expressly disagreed with the **Eleventh Circuit**, ruling that **Texas's** provisions likely do not implicate **First Amendment** rights. The court suggested that **NetChoice** was trying to assert a ""right to censor what people say,"" which it deemed unprotected. Alternatively, the court held that even if the law restricted protected expression, it was a content- and viewpoint-neutral law (subject to ""intermediate scrutiny""), and **Texas's** interest in protecting the free exchange of ideas was sufficient to uphold it.

In essence, **NetChoice**, representing major internet companies, is challenging both **Florida's** and **Texas's** laws because they believe these regulations force private platforms to host content they might otherwise choose to remove, thereby compelling speech and infringing on the platforms' own editorial freedom, which they argue is protected by the **First Amendment**. The differing preliminary outcomes in the **Eleventh** and **Fifth Circuits** highlight an ongoing legal debate about the nature of social media platforms and the scope of their **First Amendment** rights."

Demand-Pull Inflation
Inflation that is caused by an increase in aggregate demand (overall spending) absent a
proportional increase in aggregate supply (overall production) is known as demand-pull inflation.
When aggregate demand increases by more than its trend rate, typically the productive capacity
of the economy does not immediately adjust to meet higher demand, particularly if the economy
is at or near full employment.16 In response to the increased demand in the economy, producers
will attempt to increase the quantity of goods and services they provide. To increase production,
producers may attempt to hire more workers by increasing wages. Assuming producers are not
willing to eat into profits in order to ramp up production,17 they are likely to increase the prices of
their final goods and services to compensate themselves for the increase in wages (which
increases production costs), thereby creating inflation.18 Inflation can work to lower demand and
increase supply and thus can be the means to bring supply and demand back into equilibrium,
particularly in an overheating economy in which demand has risen above what the economy can
produce at full employment.19
Any number of factors could contribute to increases in aggregate demand, including the normal
ebbs and flows of the business cycle, consumer and investor sentiment, the value of the dollar,
and fiscal and monetary policy, among others. Expansionary fiscal policies include an increase in
the budget deficit by lowering taxes or increasing government spending or transfers to
individuals. Such policies work to increase overall spending in the economy by driving up
consumer demand, in the case of lower taxes, or both consumer demand and government
purchases in the case of increased spending. This in turn can lead to increased production and
decreasing unemployment levels. The downside to achieving these benefits through expansionary
fiscal policy is that it can result in demand-pull inflation in the short term, particularly if the
economy is at full employment. Expansionary fiscal policy is unlikely to cause sustained
inflation, as it typically involves temporary increases in spending. Such one-time increases may
produce similar one-time increases in inflation but would be likely to cause persistent increases in
inflation only if such policy were persistently applied. Additionally, monetary policy can
potentially be used to offset the inflationary effects of such policy.
Cost-Push Inflation
Inflation that is caused by a decrease in aggregate supply as a result of increases in the cost of
production absent a proportional decrease in aggregate demand is known as cost-push inflation.
An increase in the cost of raw materials or any of the factors of production—land, labor, capital,
entrepreneurship—will result in increased production costs.23 Assuming producers’ productivity
is at or near its maximum, producers will not be able to maintain existing profit margins in
response. Much the same as the demand-side issue, if producers cannot or will not accept lowered
profits, they will raise prices.24
The classic example of cost-push inflation is the result of a commodity price shock, which
sharply decreases the supply of a given commodity and increases its price. Certain commodities
are inputs in the production process, and as the price of an important input good increases, so
does the price of the final goods and services, resulting in inflation. Cost-push inflation,
especially when caused by a supply shock, tends to result in only a temporary increase in inflation
unless accommodated by monetary policy. Supply disruptions are often alleviated naturally, and
for inflation to be persistently high, supply shock after supply shock would need to occur.25
One of the reasons a commodity shock in particular is a widely cited example of something that
causes cost-push inflation is that demand for many commodities is considered to be inelastic. The
elasticity of demand refers to how consumers’ appetite for a good changes given the price it is
offered at.26 A completely inelastic good is one that consumers would purchase at the same rate
regardless of the price. For example, demand for oil and its derivative petroleum products—such
as gasoline, diesel fuel, and petrochemicals—is generally fairly inelastic, because they are
necessary purchases for consumers and businesses, with few substitutes readily available.
Another commonly cited example of cost-push inflation is caused by increases in the cost of
labor, often referred to as wage-push inflation. An increase in the federal minimum wage, for
example, could theoretically cause inflation. When producers need to pay their workers more,
they may opt to pass that cost along to the consumer, reduce profits to pay the increased cost, or
decrease the amount of workers they employ to keep costs down. The extent to which an increase
in wages affects the price level depends largely on how many workers are affected by the wage
increase and the size of the increase. In the case of the minimum wage, very few workers or very
many workers could be affected, depending on the level of increase. 

USER REQUEST:
Explain the differences between demand-pull inflation and cost-push inflation with examples.","Demand-pull inflation is caused by an increase in aggregate demand (overall spending) without a proportional increase in aggregate supply (overall production) (Demand-Pull Inflation section). This occurs when aggregate demand increases more than the economy's productive capacity, especially at or near full employment, leading producers to increase prices to cover higher wages and production costs (Demand-Pull Inflation section). Factors that can contribute to demand-pull inflation include the business cycle, consumer and investor sentiment, the value of the dollar, and fiscal and monetary policy (Demand-Pull Inflation section). An example is expansionary fiscal policies, such as an increase in the budget deficit by lowering taxes or increasing government spending or transfers, which drive up overall spending and consumer demand (Demand-Pull Inflation section).

Cost-push inflation is caused by a decrease in aggregate supply due to increases in the cost of production, without a proportional decrease in aggregate demand (Cost-Push Inflation section). When the cost of raw materials or any factors of production (land, labor, capital, entrepreneurship) increases, producers may raise prices to maintain profit margins (Cost-Push Inflation section). Examples of cost-push inflation include:
*   A commodity price shock, where a sharp decrease in the supply of a commodity (like oil) increases its price, subsequently increasing the price of final goods and services that use it as an input (Cost-Push Inflation section).
*   Increases in the cost of labor, known as wage-push inflation. An increase in the federal minimum wage, for instance, could cause producers to pass this increased cost along to consumers (Cost-Push Inflation section).","That's a great question, and understanding the difference between demand-pull and cost-push inflation is key to grasping how inflation can impact an economy! Let's break them down:

### Demand-Pull Inflation

Imagine a situation where everyone suddenly has more money to spend or feels very confident about the future, leading them to buy more goods and services. This is the essence of **demand-pull inflation**.

**What it is:** Demand-pull inflation occurs when there's an **increase in overall spending (aggregate demand)** in the economy, but the **economy's ability to produce goods and services (aggregate supply) doesn't keep up** proportionally. Think of it like too many people trying to buy too few items. When demand outstrips supply, producers realize they can charge more, and prices go up. This is especially true if the economy is already operating at or near its full capacity, meaning it can't easily ramp up production.

**How it happens:**
1.  **Increased Demand:** People and businesses want to buy more.
2.  **Limited Supply:** Producers can't immediately make enough to meet this higher demand, especially if they're already working at full capacity.
3.  **Rising Production Costs (initially):** To try and increase production, businesses might hire more workers or offer higher wages to attract staff.
4.  **Price Increases:** To cover these higher production costs and capitalize on strong demand, producers raise the prices of their final goods and services, leading to inflation.

**Examples:**
*   **Government Stimulus Checks or Tax Cuts:** If a government provides a large number of stimulus checks or significantly cuts taxes, people suddenly have more disposable income. If they all decide to spend that money at once on cars, appliances, or vacations, the demand for these goods and services can surge beyond what producers can supply, leading to higher prices.
*   **Booming Economy/High Consumer Confidence:** When people feel secure in their jobs and optimistic about the future, they tend to spend more and save less. This widespread increase in consumer spending can drive up aggregate demand.
*   **Low Interest Rates:** When central banks lower interest rates, borrowing becomes cheaper, encouraging businesses to invest and consumers to take out loans for big purchases (like homes or cars), boosting overall demand.

### Cost-Push Inflation

Now, imagine that the cost of making things suddenly goes up for businesses, regardless of how much people want to buy. This is **cost-push inflation**.

**What it is:** Cost-push inflation happens when there's a **decrease in the overall supply (aggregate supply)** of goods and services due to **higher production costs**, without a corresponding drop in overall spending. Essentially, it costs more to produce the same amount of goods, so producers pass those higher costs onto consumers in the form of higher prices.

**How it happens:**
1.  **Increased Production Costs:** The cost of raw materials, labor, or other inputs rises significantly.
2.  **Decreased Supply (or higher cost to maintain existing supply):** With higher costs, producers can't maintain their existing profit margins without raising prices. They might even have to reduce output if costs become too prohibitive.
3.  **Price Increases:** Producers raise prices to cover the increased expenses and maintain profitability, leading to inflation.

**Examples:**
*   **Oil Price Shocks:** This is a classic example! If there's a sudden disruption in global oil supply (e.g., due to political instability, natural disaster, or cartel decisions), the price of crude oil skyrockets. Since oil is a crucial input for transportation, manufacturing, and many products (like plastics), the cost of producing almost everything goes up. Businesses then pass these higher costs onto consumers through increased prices for gasoline, goods, and services.
*   **Wage-Push Inflation:** If there's a widespread increase in wages, perhaps due to a significant rise in the minimum wage or strong union negotiations, businesses face higher labor costs. If they can't absorb these costs by increasing productivity or reducing profits, they will likely raise the prices of their products to compensate.
*   **Supply Chain Disruptions:** Events like pandemics or major natural disasters can disrupt global supply chains, making it more expensive and difficult to get raw materials, components, or finished goods to market. This scarcity and increased shipping cost translates into higher prices for consumers.

### Key Differences Summarized

| Feature            | Demand-Pull Inflation                                | Cost-Push Inflation                                 |
| :----------------- | :--------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| **Root Cause**     | **Too much demand** for goods and services.          | **Increased costs** of production.                  |
| **Starting Point** | An increase in **aggregate demand**.                 | A decrease in **aggregate supply**.                 |
| **Impact on Output** | Often occurs when the economy is at **full capacity**, trying to increase output to meet demand. | Can lead to **reduced output** as businesses struggle with higher costs. |
| **Typical Scenario** | ""Too much money chasing too few goods.""             | ""Higher costs forcing higher prices.""               |
| **Examples**       | Government spending, tax cuts, strong consumer confidence, low interest rates. | Commodity price shocks (e.g., oil), wage increases, supply chain disruptions. |

In short, demand-pull inflation is about consumers wanting more and bidding up prices, while cost-push inflation is about producers facing higher expenses and passing them onto consumers. Both result in higher prices, but they stem from very different economic forces!"

2.3 VPNs and Extranets
 

  The term 'extranet' is commonly used to refer to a scenario whereby
  two or more companies have networked access to a limited amount of
  each other's corporate data. For example a manufacturing company
  might use an extranet for its suppliers to allow it to query
  databases for the pricing and availability of components, and then to
  order and track the status of outstanding orders. Another example is
  joint software development, for instance, company A allows one
  development group within company B to access its operating system
  source code, and company B allows one development group in company A
  to access its security software. Note that the access policies can
  get arbitrarily complex. For example company B may internally
  restrict access to its security software to groups in certain
  geographic locations to comply with export control laws, for example.
 

  A key feature of an extranet is thus the control of who can access
  what data, and this is essentially a policy decision. Policy
  decisions are typically enforced today at the interconnection points
  between different domains, for example between a private network and
  the Internet, or between a software test lab and the rest of the
  company network. The enforcement may be done via a firewall, router
  with access list functionality, application gateway, or any similar
  device capable of applying policy to transit traffic. Policy
  controls may be implemented within a corporate network, in addition
  to between corporate networks. Also the interconnections between
  networks could be a set of bilateral links, or could be a separate
  network, perhaps maintained by an industry consortium. This separate
  network could itself be a VPN or a physical network.
 

  Introducing VPNs into a network does not require any change to this
  model. Policy can be enforced between two VPNs, or between a VPN and
  the Internet, in exactly the same manner as is done today without
  VPNs. For example two VPNs could be interconnected, which each
  administration locally imposing its own policy controls, via a
  firewall, on all traffic that enters its VPN from the outside,
  whether from another VPN or from the Internet.
 

  This model of a VPN provides for a separation of policy from the
  underlying mode of packet transport used. For example, a router may
  direct voice traffic to ATM Virtual Channel Connections (VCCs) for
  guaranteed QoS, non-local internal company traffic to secure tunnels,
  and other traffic to a link to the Internet. In the past the secure
  tunnels may have been frame relay circuits, now they may also be
  secure IP tunnels or MPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs)
 

 

 

 

 

 

 Gleeson, et al. Informational [Page 9]
 

 RFC 2764  IP Based Virtual Private Networks  February 2000
 

 

  Other models of a VPN are also possible. For example there is a
  model whereby a set of application flows is mapped into a VPN. As
  the policy rules imposed by a network administrator can get quite
  complex, the number of distinct sets of application flows that are
  used in the policy rulebase, and hence the number of VPNs, can thus
  grow quite large, and there can be multiple overlapping VPNs.
  However there is little to be gained by introducing such new
  complexity into a network. Instead a VPN should be viewed as a
  direct analogue to a physical network, as this allows the leveraging
  of existing protocols and procedures, and the current expertise and
  skill sets of network administrators and customers.

What is the technical difference between a VPN and an Extranet, and how do both get utilized safely in an enterprise environment without breaking connections between computers?","An extranet refers to a scenario where two or more companies have networked access to a limited amount of each other's corporate data, with a key feature being the control of who can access what data, which is a policy decision (Section 2.3). A VPN, in contrast, is viewed as a direct analogue to a physical network, providing a separation of policy from the underlying mode of packet transport used (Section 2.3). An extranet's interconnections between networks could itself be a VPN or a physical network (Section 2.3). Therefore, an extranet describes a data sharing scenario governed by policy, while a VPN is a technology for packet transport that can be used to facilitate an extranet.

Both extranets and VPNs are utilized safely without breaking connections by enforcing policy decisions at interconnection points between different domains (Section 2.3). This enforcement can be carried out using devices like firewalls, routers with access list functionality, or application gateways, which are capable of applying policy to transit traffic (Section 2.3). Policy controls can be implemented within a corporate network and between corporate networks (Section 2.3). When VPNs are introduced, this model does not require change; policy can still be enforced between two VPNs, or between a VPN and the Internet, in the same manner as without VPNs (Section 2.3). For instance, two VPNs could be interconnected, with each administration locally imposing its own policy controls via a firewall on all traffic entering its VPN from the outside (Section 2.3).","That's a great question, and the document provides an excellent foundation for understanding the nuances between extranets and VPNs, especially in how they're used securely in an enterprise environment!

Let's break down the technical differences and how they work together safely.

### The Technical Difference Between a VPN and an Extranet

The core distinction lies in their **purpose and scope**:

1.  **Extranet:**
    *   **What it is:** An extranet is primarily a **concept or scenario** that describes controlled network access *between two or more different organizations* (companies, suppliers, partners, customers). It's about securely sharing a *limited amount* of corporate data or resources with trusted external entities.
    *   **Focus:** Its focus is on **policy decisions** – specifically, *who* (which external entity or user) can access *what* specific data or applications within an organization's network.
    *   **Example:** A manufacturing company allowing its suppliers to check inventory, pricing, and place orders directly into its database. Or, two companies collaborating on software development, sharing specific source code repositories.
    *   **Implementation:** An extranet isn't a single technology but an architecture that can be built using various networking and security tools. As the document mentions, the actual interconnections could be bilateral links, a separate network, or even a VPN.

2.  **VPN (Virtual Private Network):**
    *   **What it is:** A VPN is a **technology or mechanism** that creates a secure, encrypted ""tunnel"" over a less secure network (like the public internet). This tunnel allows data to travel privately and securely, making it *appear* as if the connected devices are part of the same private network.
    *   **Focus:** Its focus is on **secure data transport** – ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of data as it travels across networks. It provides the ""pipes"" through which information flows securely.
    *   **Example:** A remote employee securely accessing their company's internal network from home. Or, two company branches connecting their private networks securely over the internet.
    *   **Implementation:** VPNs use encryption and tunneling protocols (like IPsec, SSL/TLS, OpenVPN, WireGuard) to establish and maintain these secure connections.

**In essence:** An **extranet defines *what* is shared and *with whom*** (a business relationship and access policy), while a **VPN defines *how* that sharing is securely transported** (a technical method for secure communication).

You can think of it this way: An extranet is like deciding *which specific confidential documents* you'll let a trusted partner read. A VPN is like the *locked, armored vehicle* you use to transport those documents securely across town. The armored vehicle (VPN) doesn't decide *what's inside* (extranet data), it just ensures its safe journey.

### How Both Are Utilized Safely in an Enterprise Environment Without Breaking Connections

The document highlights that safety and preventing unwanted disruptions come down to robust **policy enforcement** at the interconnection points. Here's how:

1.  **Policy is King:**
    *   The most crucial aspect is defining clear access policies: *who* can access *what* data, *when*, and *how*. This is a business decision first and foremost.
    *   Policies are not just for external access; they can also be implemented *within* a corporate network.

2.  **Strategic Enforcement Points:**
    *   Policy decisions are typically enforced at ""interconnection points."" These are the gateways where different network ""domains"" meet. Examples include:
        *   Between a private corporate network and the public internet.
        *   Between different companies' networks (for an extranet).
        *   Between a sensitive internal segment (like a software test lab) and the broader company network.

3.  **Security Devices for Enforcement:**
    *   The heavy lifting of enforcing these policies is done by specialized network security devices:
        *   **Firewalls:** These are paramount. They inspect incoming and outgoing network traffic and allow or block it based on predefined rules. They can filter by IP address, port number, application, user, and much more.
        *   **Routers with Access List Functionality (ACLs):** Many routers can be configured with Access Control Lists to permit or deny traffic based on source/destination IP addresses, protocols, and ports, acting as a basic firewall.
        *   **Application Gateways (Proxy Servers):** These can provide even more granular control by inspecting traffic at the application layer, understanding the commands and data within specific applications (e.g., controlling what specific SQL queries a supplier can run against a database).

4.  **VPNs as Secure Transport, Not Policy Enforcers:**
    *   Crucially, the document states, ""Introducing VPNs into a network does not require any change to this model. Policy can be enforced between two VPNs, or between a VPN and the Internet, in exactly the same manner as is done today without VPNs.""
    *   This means the **VPN provides the secure, encrypted tunnel for the data**, but the **firewalls and other enforcement devices still sit at the ""ends"" of these tunnels** (or before/after them) to decide *what traffic is allowed to enter or exit* the protected network *through* the VPN.
    *   Think of the VPN as the secure road, and the firewalls as the guarded checkpoints at the entrance and exit of that road, inspecting every vehicle (data packet) to ensure it has the proper authorization before letting it pass into the corporate city.

5.  **Separation of Policy and Transport:**
    *   This separation is key to security and flexibility. The VPN handles the secure delivery (the transport), while other devices handle the access control (the policy). This allows administrators to choose the best transport method (e.g., high QoS for voice traffic, secure IP tunnels for sensitive internal traffic) while applying consistent security policies.

By combining the secure communication provided by VPNs with the granular access control enforced by firewalls and other security devices, enterprises can safely implement extranets. Connections are *not* broken universally; instead, only unauthorized or policy-violating connections are blocked, while legitimate and authorized access is facilitated securely."

The Bottom Line
Credit cards offer valuable benefits for both
consumers and retailers. And the majority of
Canadians use their credit card as a method
of payment rather than a means of borrowing.
Credit card benefits
For Consumers
A credit card is a convenient and flexible payment tool
accepted in more than 200 countries and at millions of
locations worldwide. Benefits include:
• Access to unsecured credit (no collateral required
against amounts charged).
• Interest-free payment from time of purchase to the end
of the billing period.
• Instant payment of purchases, allowing for instant
receipt of goods and services.
Focus: Credit Cards:
Statistics and Facts
Focus Sheet
• Credit cards provide
interest-free credit
from the time of
purchase to the end
of the billing period
• More than 70% of
Canadians pay their
credit card balance
in full each month1 ,
so for them the
interest rate is zero
• For those who
choose to carry a
balance:
o Credit cards offer
access to
unsecured credit
(no collateral
required)
o There are many
low interest rate
cards on the
market and over
30 of those cards
have an interest
rate of under 13%
FAST FACTS
• Coverage for purchases if the item is damaged, stolen
or not delivered within 90 days.
• 24/7 access.
• Fraud protection with zero liability to the consumer in
cases of fraud.
• Other rewards and benefits, such as air travel points,
car insurance, damage and loss insurance and
extended warranty programs.
For retailers
Retailers are not required to accept credit cards, but do so
to provide payments options for their customers. Retailers
that do accept credit cards receive many benefits, including:
• Reaching a large customer base – Credit cards are the
preferred method of payment for many customers, and
customers will select retailers that allow them to choose
their preferred method of payment.
• Fast, guaranteed payment, which can reduce line-ups
at checkout. If every credit card transaction took an
extra 30 seconds, it would use up an additional 27
million hours of staff time each year.
• The ability of accepting credit without worrying about
the creditworthiness of customers, insufficient funds or
outstanding receivables.
• Reduced cash on hand and cash handling time and
costs, including counting cash at the end of the day,
armoured transport, higher likelihood of theft and
pilfering and potential mistakes by cashiers.
• Expanded markets; ability to sell to customers
throughout Canada and around the world in the
currency used by the retailer.
• Access to innovative new payments – innovations in
payment options introduced by banks and credit card
companies, such as contactless cards and online and
mobile payments, benefit retailers and make it easier
for customer to make purchases.
Moreover, a very large majority (94 per cent) of merchants
say their business benefits from accepting credit cards.2
• Sixty-nine per cent of merchants say they benefit
from letting customers earn rewards on their
purchases. 3
Competition and choice
When making a purchase, consumers can choose to use
cash, cheques, debit cards, credit cards as well as
electronic payments services like PayPal and Interac
Online. Nearly nine out of ten adult Canadians have at least
one credit card4 and this method of payment is the choice
for the overwhelming majority of retail e-commerce
transactions.
When it comes to choosing a credit card, banks offer
consumers a wide variety of products. Customers may
choose among standard cards without an annual fee,
premium cards that offer rewards and features, and low-rate
cards if the interest rate is a key consideration influencing
the card choice.
• Hundreds of institutions in Canada, including banks,
credit unions, retailers, caisses populaires, trust
companies and finance companies offer credit card
products.
• 76.2 million Visa and MasterCard cards are in
circulation in Canada. 5
• There are many low-rate cards on the market and over
30 of those cards have an interest rate of under 13%.
• Eight in 10 (84 per cent) consumers are satisfied with
their credit cards and roughly the same proportion (86
per cent) say they offer great value. 6
• Canadians appreciate their rewards points programs
and the majority use them to help make a family
vacation more attainable with travel points, save money
on their grocery bills with cash-back rewards or use
their rewards points to donate to a favourite charity.
• Research has found that eighty-three per cent of
consumers use a credit card that provides them
with rewards. 7
• 58 per cent of Canadians who are frequent credit
card users listed “receiving discounts/loyalty
points/rewards’’ as their main reason for frequently
using credit cards for purchases. 8
• Roughly two-thirds of consumers (65 per cent) say
credit card purchases are advantageous to
merchants and directly help them grow their
businesses. 9
Consumers should visit the Financial Consumer Agency of
Canada (FCAC) website www.fcac.gc.ca, for an extensive list
of cards and features, and use the credit card comparison tool
to help select the card that best suits their needs.
Strong regulations 10
Consumers with credit cards from banks are protected by
Bank Act regulations that require:
• Statements to include itemized transactions, the
amount you must pay on or before the due date in
order to have the benefit of a grace period.
• Disclosure of the previous month’s payments and the
current month’s purchases, credit advances, as well as
interest and non-interest charges.
• Disclosure of the interest rate at the time of solicitation
or application, and on every monthly statement.
• Plain language information for customers.
• Rules on advertising.
• Limits on consumer liability in the event of fraud.
Credit card pricing
There are a number of factors that influence card fees and
interest rates.
• An interest-free period from purchase to payment,
depending on the card, as long as the balance is paid
in full when owing.
• Access to unsecured credit where no collateral is needed,
which makes it a higher risk for the credit card issuer.
• Significant costs to operating the credit card system
including processing a large volume of transactions,
technology that is constantly updated to support
transactions, preparing and mailing statements,
collecting payments and the costs for providing value-
added rewards programs.
Most Canadians pay cards off every month
• A Payments Canada survey found that 71% of
Canadians pay their balance off in full every month. 11
• Banks work with clients who are concerned about their
debt, helping them get control of their finances or
choose more suitable credit products. Banks also
support non-profit credit counseling services.
The Canadian Bankers Association is the voice of more than 60
domestic and foreign banks that help drive Canada’s economic
growth and prosperity. The CBA advocates for public policies
that contribute to a sound, thriving banking system to ensure
Canadians can succeed in their financial goals.

**Customer Relationship Management Systems**
What is a CRM system?
A CRM system gathers, links, and analyses all collected customer data, including contact information, interactions with company representatives, purchases, service requests, assets, and quotes/proposals. The system then lets users access that data and understand what happened at each touchpoint. Through this understanding, a complete customer profile is developed, and a solid customer relationship is built.

Customer data can also be aggregated to populate incentive compensation modelling, sales forecasting, territory segmentation, campaign design, product innovation, and other sales, marketing, and customer service activities. CRM tools and software help you streamline the customer engagement process, close more sales deals, establish strong customer relationships, build customer loyalty, and ultimately increase sales and profits.

Who should use a CRM?
CRM tools have almost always been seen as sales tools. However, over time, these solutions have extended their reach and become integral to marketing, ecommerce, and customer service functions.

The power of customer relationship management is derived by constantly gathering customer data, analysing that data, and then using those insights to deepen relationships and improve business results. It allows any customer-facing employee to convey, ""We know you, and we value you.""

A set of data-driven CRM tools supports you beyond the sales process, which is crucial to business performance. With the in-depth knowledge of your customers, you can:

Offer and sell new, add-on products—at the right time in the right way at the right price
Help customer service teams resolve issues faster
Help development teams create better products and services
CRM: What is the goal?
CRM software supports strong, productive, loyal customer relationships through informed and superior customer experiences. The goal? To improve customer acquisition and retention by providing experiences that keep your customers coming back. Customer relationship management is both a strategy and a tool that supports those experiences in five key ways.

1
Answer the most basic customer questions
Customer relationship management helps you find new customers, sell to them, and develop a loyal customer relationship with them. These systems collect many different types of customer data and organize it so you understand your customers/prospects better and can answer (or even anticipate) their questions.

2
Manage customer data
Bad decisions come from a lack of access to and inability to interpret customer data. Being able to store, track, and validate customer data within an automated system will allow sales and marketing teams to optimize customer engagement strategies and build better relationships.

3
Automate the sales process
Sales force automation makes selling more efficient, helping you sell more quickly. The best CRM systems use artificial intelligence (AI) and unified customer data to automate the sales process by prompting sellers with recommended next-best actions.

4
Personalize marketing campaigns
Customers and potential customers arrive through various channels, including websites, social media, email, online/offline events, etc. Unfortunately, many businesses struggle to connect marketing efforts across all these channels. Marketing teams can improve conversions, strengthen customer relationships, and align messaging across their digital customer channels by leveraging CRM systems.

5
Align sales and marketing
With customer relationship management, marketing and sales work better together to drive sales and increase revenue. When sales and marketing are in sync, sales productivity goes up along with marketing ROI.

CRM features and benefits
Customer relationship management solutions are one of the largest and fastest-growing enterprise application software categories. The CRM market size was valued at $41.93 billion in 2019 and is projected to reach $96.39 billion by 2027, growing at a CAGR of 11.1% from 2020 to 2027.

More and more companies are using CRM solutions to acquire more sales leads, improve the sales pipeline, boost productivity, and improve customer satisfaction. However, many have encountered problems ranging from cost overruns and CRM integration challenges to system limitations. These are avoidable problems, and you can help ensure success by focusing on a customer-first strategy.

It's critical for businesses to have integrated, customizable, and comprehensive views into their customers’ and potential customers’ solution/product interests, customer service needs, and purchase history. A good CRM system should provide that view. All data is in a single location, viewable through optimized dashboards.

Additionally, your marketing team can leverage CRM solutions to orchestrate personalized marketing and lead generation campaigns. These systems can help track all cross-channel interactions—from engagement to purchase. Mature cloud CRM solutions do more. They are fully integrated with back-office solutions to successfully support the entire customer journey.

Because it manages prospect and customer engagement points across all channels, your CRM system can inform all your communications and marketing activities, delivering the 360-degree customer view needed for a truly connected omnichannel experience.

Many different vendors have many different types of solutions. However, a few capabilities are must-haves.

Be easy to use, or people won't use it
Fit within your budget and provide an acceptable ROI
Integrate well with your other software systems
Provide accurate, consistent data for that much-needed, complete customer 360-degree view
Types of CRM
CRM software solutions, at their core, are used to manage customer relationships and sales interactions. Still, many businesses leverage these systems simply as a sales force automation tool. But these solutions, such as Oracle's, offer many more valuable capabilities that span a wide range of marketing and sales functions, including marketing, customer service, sales, and partner channel management.

Today’s CRM software can support the entire customer journey. But what one company may need from a CRM system can be vastly different from what another company might require. To help you select the right CRM for your organization, it’s helpful to know that there are three main types of CRM solutions: collaborative, operational, and analytical.

CRM and data
Data is the most critical part of any CRM software solution. In fact, customer data is the starting point for all marketing and sales activities. Successful customer engagement and relationship strategies hinge on accurate, complete, and accessible customer profiles. Bad data comes from several places, including:

Fraudulently entered data
Keystroke errors
Duplicate customer information
Natural changes (company bankruptcy, job changes)
Incomplete and inaccurate data can increase quickly to degrade the value of your CRM tools, resulting in unnecessary expenses. Conversely, when customer data is complete and accurate, businesses stand a better chance of reaching their target customers and prospects. In short, your data is a valuable asset. So it’s important to focus on collecting and optimizing these four CRM data types:

Identity data
Identity data includes descriptive details to identify customers, leads, and contacts. This data should be used for marketing segmentation.

Descriptive data
Descriptive data includes lifestyle details relevant to your contacts. It is what completes that all-important 360-degree view of leads and contacts.

Quantitative data
Quantitative data includes measurable data points that can help you interpret how your leads and contacts have interacted with you.

Qualitative data
Qualitative data can help you better understand your contacts’ intent, including search behaviours related to buying decisions.

CRM vs. marketing automation
Both CRM and marketing automation systems are data-driven. They focus on gathering, storing, and using data. For example, marketing automation systems gather leads by communicating with potential and current customers.

Specifically, marketing automation looks to gather enough customer data points to show intent and then hands that person off to the sales team as a marketing-qualified lead (MQL). A CRM solution picks up where the marketing automation solution left off and works to convert those marketing-qualified leads into contacts.

AI in CRM

Discover the next generation of CRM (0:38)
The best CRM systems offer robust analytics coupled with AI and machine learning. AI is the future of customer relationship management, going beyond contact management and sales force automation to truly helping you sell.

AI in CRM can guide you toward the next-best actions and provide smart talking points—specific to each customer opportunity. AI also delivers timely customer intelligence that helps you optimize customer experience (CX) across marketing, sales, and customer service.

CRM vs. CX
When customer relationship management first arrived on the scene, businesses would capture data but not know what to do with it. Today, CRM systems are integrated with AI, which helps interpret and predict what that data means.

CRM AI capabilities are the foundation to using a 360-degree view of the customer that will start them on their way to becoming your customer. As these AI enhancements continue to evolve, CX will continue to improve—and in turn, customer expectations will continue to increase.

Your business needs to fully understand your customers (and how they buy) to not only meet their expectations but to provide them with compelling experiences. This is the future of CX and should serve as your guide to selecting the best CRM solution.

How CRM improves customer experience
A complete customer view is necessary for business success and growth. Without a CRM system, you'll struggle to develop that much-needed 360-degree view of the customer that you need to:

Personalize customer interactions
Automate business processes (with appropriate CX integrations)
Track all customer interactions

At its core, a CRM aims to build stronger, more profitable relationships.

Based on the document, here are five key goals of implementing a CRM system:

1.  **Improve Customer Acquisition and Retention:** This is the overarching goal. A CRM system helps businesses attract new customers by understanding their needs and preferences, and more importantly, it helps retain existing customers by providing superior, informed experiences that encourage repeat business and loyalty. It does this by creating a complete customer profile and understanding every touchpoint.

2.  **Effectively Manage Customer Data:** A primary goal is to centralize and organize all customer data – from contact details and purchase history to service requests and interactions. By storing, tracking, and validating this data in an automated system, CRM ensures that sales and marketing teams have accurate and accessible information, leading to better decision-making and optimized customer engagement strategies. This prevents bad decisions that stem from a lack of data access or interpretation.

3.  **Automate the Sales Process:** CRM systems aim to make selling more efficient and faster. Through features like sales force automation, often enhanced with AI and machine learning, CRMs can prompt sellers with recommended ""next-best actions,"" streamline workflows, and ultimately help close more sales deals. This frees up sales teams to focus on building relationships rather than administrative tasks.

4.  **Personalize Marketing Campaigns:** A CRM helps enterprises connect their marketing efforts across various channels (websites, social media, email, events) by providing a unified view of customer interactions. This allows marketing teams to craft highly personalized campaigns, improve conversion rates, and deliver consistent messaging that resonates with individual customers and prospects, thereby strengthening relationships.

5.  **Align Sales and Marketing Teams:** One crucial goal is to break down silos between sales and marketing departments. By providing a shared, consistent view of customer data and interactions, a CRM system enables these teams to work together more effectively. This alignment leads to increased sales productivity and a better return on investment (ROI) for marketing efforts, ultimately driving higher revenue.

Beyond these core goals, CRM implementation also strives to improve customer service by enabling faster issue resolution, aid product development teams in creating better offerings based on customer feedback, and provide a 360-degree view of the customer for a truly connected omnichannel experience. The overall aim is to foster a customer-first strategy that drives business growth and success."

Law Enforcement Identification When Executing a Warrant
Overview
As noted above, amid recent calls for legislative changes to police practices, another area that has received attention concerns the authority for law enforcement officers to execute a warrant by entering a home without first seeking consensual entry by announcing themselves and their purpose. As a default, law enforcement officers must comply with the knock and announce rule— an “ancient” common-law doctrine, which generally requires officers to knock and announce their presence before entering a home to execute a search warrant. The Supreme Court has interpreted the Fourth Amendment’s reasonableness requirement as generally mandating compliance with the knock and announce rule. The knock and announce rule is also codified in a federal statute, but the Supreme Court has interpreted that statute as “prohibiting nothing” and “merely [authorizing] officers to damage property [upon entry] in certain instances.” When officers violate the knock and announce rule, they may be subject to civil lawsuits and “internal police discipline.” However, in Hudson v. Michigan the Supreme Court curtailed the remedies available for knock and announce violations by concluding that evidence obtained following such a violation is not subject to the exclusionary rule, which “prevents the government from using most evidence gathered in violation of the United States Constitution.”
There are two closely related exceptions to the knock and announce rule, the first of which is for exigent circumstances. Exigent circumstances are those where the “police have a ‘reasonable suspicion’ that knocking and announcing would be dangerous, futile, or destructive to the purposes of the investigation.” Typical examples include instances where police believe that the suspect is armed or likely to destroy evidence. Exigent circumstances must be based on the “particular circumstances” of each case, and may not amount to a “blanket exception to the [knock and announce] requirement” for “entire categor[ies] of criminal activity.” For example, the Supreme Court rejected an assertion that “police officers are never required to knock and announce their presence when executing a search warrant in a felony drug investigation.” Instead, “in each case, it is the duty of a court confronted with the question to determine whether the facts and circumstances of the particular entry justified dispensing with the knock-and-announce requirement.”
The second exception is for no-knock warrants, which provide explicit authority for judges to grant so-called “no-knock” entry in the warrant itself, upon a finding of certain factual predicates. The justifications for no-knock warrants are similar to, and sometimes described interchangeably with, the concept of exigent circumstances. No-knock warrants, and exigent circumstances, both typically involve instances where there is a risk that knocking and announcing would endanger officers or result in the destruction of evidence. A key distinction between no-knock warrants and no-knock entry pursuant to the exigent circumstances exception is temporal. With no-knock warrants, officers “have anticipated exigent circumstances before searching, and have asked for pre-search judicial approval to enter without knocking.” In contrast, when officers lack a no-knock warrant and enter without knocking due to exigent circumstances the justification for bypassing knock and announce requirements may arise as late as when the officers are at the door. A number of states have statutes that authorize magistrate judges to grant no-knock warrants in certain circumstances. Although a federal statute previously authorized no-knock warrants for certain drug searches, Congress repealed it. As a result, the legal status of federal no-knock search warrants is unsettled, although federal officers do sometimes employ no-knock warrants or act pursuant to no-knock warrants issued by state courts when serving on joint state-federal task forces.
From a Fourth Amendment standpoint, the Supreme Court has indicated some approval of “[t]he practice of allowing magistrates to issue no-knock warrants . . . when sufficient cause to do so can be demonstrated ahead of time,” assuming that the practice does not amount to a blanket exception to knock and announce. However, one unresolved question is whether federal courts have authority to issue no-
Congressional Research Service 4
knock warrants in the absence of a statute expressly providing that power, as federal courts “possess only that power authorized by Constitution and statute . . . .” The DOJ has concluded that federal courts are authorized to do so, in large part because the federal rule governing search warrants has been broadly interpreted by courts in other contexts to include specific searches that it does not expressly authorize.
In one sense, the legal vitality of federal no-knock warrants may be of limited practical significance; as noted, federal law enforcement officers may still be permitted to enter a home without knocking and announcing if exigent circumstances are present. However, some courts have concluded that no-knock warrants shield officers from responsibility for independently assessing the existence of exigent circumstances at the time of entry. To the extent that is true, no-knock warrants could permit no-knock entry where the exigent circumstances exception would not—for example, in an instance where the factors that justified the no-knock warrant are no longer present at the time of entry. Relatedly, if a valid no-knock warrant provides such a shield against the responsibility of reassessing exigent circumstances at the time of entry, it could limit the availability of civil lawsuits as a remedy where officers disregard knock and announce requirements pursuant to a no-knock warrant, but exigent circumstances no longer exist at the time of entry.

What sort of differences exist in the various exceptions to the knock-and-announce rule?","There are two closely related exceptions to the knock and announce rule: exigent circumstances and no-knock warrants (Congressional Research Service 4).

Differences include:
*   **Temporal distinction** No-knock warrants involve officers anticipating exigent circumstances before searching and asking for pre-search judicial approval to enter without knocking (Congressional Research Service 4). In contrast, when officers lack a no-knock warrant and enter without knocking due to exigent circumstances, the justification for bypassing the knock and announce requirements may arise as late as when the officers are at the door (Congressional Research Service 4).
*   **Officer Responsibility** Some courts have concluded that no-knock warrants shield officers from the responsibility of independently assessing the existence of exigent circumstances at the time of entry (Congressional Research Service 4). This could permit no-knock entry even where the exigent circumstances exception would not, such as when the factors that justified the no-knock warrant are no longer present at the time of entry (Congressional Research Service 4).","The ""knock-and-announce"" rule is a fundamental requirement rooted in common law and the Fourth Amendment, generally mandating that law enforcement officers announce their presence and purpose before entering a home to execute a warrant. However, there are two primary exceptions to this rule, each with distinct characteristics:

1.  **Exigent Circumstances**
2.  **No-Knock Warrants**

Here's a breakdown of the differences between these exceptions:

### Exigent Circumstances Exception

*   **Nature:** This exception allows officers to bypass the knock-and-announce rule when they have a ""reasonable suspicion"" that knocking and announcing would be dangerous, futile, or lead to the destruction of evidence. Common examples include situations where officers believe a suspect is armed or is likely to dispose of crucial evidence.
*   **Timing of Justification:** The determination of exigent circumstances is made by the officers on the ground, and the justification can arise ""as late as when the officers are at the door."" This means it's often a real-time assessment based on immediate observations or unfolding events.
*   **Decision-Maker:** The officers themselves make the judgment that exigent circumstances exist at the moment of entry.
*   **Scope:** This exception must be based on the ""particular circumstances"" of each individual case; it cannot be applied as a blanket rule for entire categories of criminal activity (e.g., all felony drug investigations).
*   **Officer Responsibility:** Officers who enter without knocking and announcing under this exception are independently responsible for assessing and justifying the existence of exigent circumstances at the time of entry. If they violate the rule without valid exigent circumstances, they may face civil lawsuits and internal police discipline (though evidence obtained is generally not subject to the exclusionary rule).

### No-Knock Warrants Exception

*   **Nature:** Unlike exigent circumstances, a no-knock warrant provides explicit judicial authority for officers to enter a home without first knocking and announcing. This authority is granted by a judge *before* the search takes place.
*   **Timing of Justification:** With no-knock warrants, officers *anticipate* exigent circumstances beforehand and seek pre-search judicial approval to enter without knocking. The justification for no-knock entry is established and approved by a judge in advance.
*   **Decision-Maker:** A magistrate judge reviews the factual predicates presented by law enforcement and makes the determination to issue a no-knock warrant.
*   **Justifications:** The reasons for granting a no-knock warrant are similar to those for exigent circumstances—concerns about officer safety or the potential destruction of evidence. However, these concerns are vetted and approved by a judicial officer.
*   **Officer Responsibility:** A significant difference is that some courts have held that a valid no-knock warrant can ""shield officers from responsibility for independently assessing the existence of exigent circumstances at the time of entry."" This means that even if the original factors justifying the no-knock warrant are no longer present when officers arrive, the warrant itself might still authorize the no-knock entry and limit the officers' personal liability, including potential civil lawsuits.

### Key Distinctions Summarized

The most crucial differences between these two exceptions are:

*   **Temporal:** Exigent circumstances are typically a real-time assessment made by officers at the scene, potentially arising ""at the door."" No-knock warrants involve a pre-emptive judicial decision made *before* the search.
*   **Decision-Maker:** Officers decide on exigent circumstances, while a judge decides whether to issue a no-knock warrant.
*   **Judicial Approval:** No-knock warrants have explicit judicial pre-approval, whereas exigent circumstances do not require prior judicial sign-off (though they must be justifiable in court later).
*   **Officer Liability/Shield:** A valid no-knock warrant may offer a legal ""shield"" to officers, reducing their individual responsibility to reassess exigent circumstances at the moment of entry, which is not typically the case with the exigent circumstances exception alone.

In essence, while both exceptions address similar underlying concerns (safety and evidence preservation), no-knock warrants provide a formal, judicially-sanctioned authorization for unannounced entry based on anticipated risks, offering a different legal framework and potential protections for officers compared to the on-the-spot judgment of exigent circumstances."

**Mattel: Overcoming Marketing and Manufacturing Challenges**

It all started in a California garage workshop when Ruth and Elliot Handler and Matt
Matson founded Mattel in 1945. The company started out making picture frames,
but the founders soon recognized the profitability of the toy industry and switched
their emphasis. Mattel became a publicly owned company in 1960, with sales exceeding
$100 million by 1965. Over the next 40 years, Mattel went on to become the world’s
largest toy company in terms of revenue. Today, Mattel, Inc. is a world leader in the
design, manufacture, and marketing of family products. Well-known for toy brands
such as Barbie, Fisher-Price, Disney, Hot Wheels, Matchbox, Tyco, Cabbage Patch Kids,
and board games such as Scrabble, the company boasts nearly $6 billion in annual
revenue. Headquartered in El Segundo, California, with offices in 36 countries, Mattel
markets its products in more than 150 nations.
In spite of its overall success, Mattel has had its share of losses over its history.
During the mid to late 1990s, Mattel lost millions due to declining sales and bad
business acquisitions. In January 1997, Jill Barad took over as Mattel’s CEO. Barad’s
management style was characterized as strict, and her tenure at the helm proved
challenging for many employees. Although Barad had been successful in building the
Barbie brand to $2 billion near the end of the twentieth century, growth slowed rapidly
after that time. Declining sales at outlets such as Toys ‘‘R’’ Us and the mismanaged
acquisition of The Learning Company marked the start of some difficulties for the toy
maker, including a dramatic 60 percent drop in stock price under Barad’s three-year
stint as CEO. Barad accepted responsibility for these problems and resigned in 2000.
The company soon installed Robert Eckert, a 23-year Kraft veteran, as chairman
and CEO. During Eckert’s first three years on the job, the company’s stock price
increased to over $20 per share, and Mattel was ranked fortieth on Business Week’s list
of top-performing companies. Implementing techniques used by consumer-product
companies, Eckert adopted a mission to bring stability and predictability to Mattel. He
sold unprofitable units, streamlined work processes, and improved relations with
retailers. Under Eckert, Mattel was granted the highly sought-after licensing agreement for products related to the Harry Potter series of books and movies. The company
continued to flourish and build its reputation, even earning the Corporate Responsibility Award from UNICEF in 2003. By 2008, Mattel had fully realized a turnaround
and was recognized as one of Fortune magazine’s ‘‘100 Best Companies to Work For’’
and Forbes magazine’s ‘‘100 Most Trustworthy U.S. Companies.’’
Mattel’s Core Products
Barbie
Among its many lines of popular toy products, Mattel is famous for owning top girls’
brands. In 1959, Mattel made the move that would establish them at the forefront of
the toy industry. After seeing her daughter’s fascination with cutout paper dolls, Ruth
suggested that a three-dimensional doll should be produced so that young girls could
live out their dreams and fantasies. This doll was named ‘‘Barbie,’’ the nickname of
Ruth and Elliot Handler’s daughter. The first Barbie doll sported open-toed shoes, a
ponytail, sunglasses, earrings, and a zebra-striped bathing suit. Fashions and accessories 
were also available for the doll. Although buyers at the annual Toy Fair in New
York took no interest in the Barbie doll, little girls of the time certainly did. The
intense demand seen at the retail stores was insufficiently met for several years. Mattel
just could not produce the Barbie dolls fast enough. Today, Barbie is Mattel’s flagship
brand and its number one seller—routinely accounting for approximately half of
Mattel’s sales revenue. This makes Barbie the best-selling fashion doll in most global
markets. The Barbie line today includes dolls, accessories, Barbie software, and a
broad assortment of licensed products such as books, apparel, food, home furnishings,
home electronics, and movies.
Although Barbie was introduced as a teenage fashion model, she has taken on
almost every possible profession. She has also acquired numerous male and female
friends and family over the years. Ken, Midge, Skipper, Christie, and others were
introduced from the mid-1960s on. The Barbie line has even seen a disabled friend in a
wheelchair: Share a Smile Becky. Barbie’s popularity has even broken stereotypes.
Retrofitted versions of Barbie dolls, on sale in select San Francisco stores, feature
‘‘Hooker’’ Barbie, ‘‘Trailer Trash’’ Barbie, and ‘‘Drag Queen’’ Barbie. There are also
numerous ‘‘alternative’’ Barbies, such as ‘‘Big Dyke’’ Barbie, but Mattel does not want
the Barbie name to be used in these sales. Redressed and accessorized Barbies are okay
with Mattel as long as no one practices trademark infringement.
Barbie’s Popularity Slips Although Barbie remains a blockbuster by any standard,
Barbie’s popularity has slipped over the past decade. There are two major reasons for
Barbie’s slump. First, the changing lifestyles of today’s young girls are a concern for
Mattel. Many young girls prefer to spend time with music, movies, or the Internet than
play with traditional toys like dolls. Second, Barbie has suffered at the hands of new
and innovative competition, including the Bratz doll line that gained significant
market share during the early 2000s. The dolls, which featured contemporary, ethnic
designs and skimpy clothes, were a stark contrast to Barbie and an immediate hit with
young girls. In an attempt to recover, Mattel introduced the new line of My Scene dolls
aimed at ‘‘tweens.’’ These dolls are trendier, look younger, and are considered to be
more hip for this age group who is on the cusp of outgrowing playing with dolls.
A website (http://www.myscene.com) engages girls in a variety of fun, engaging, and
promotional activities.
Barbie’s Legal Battle with MGA Entertainment Since 2004, Mattel has been embroiled
in a bitter intellectual property battle with former employee Carter Bryant and MGA
Entertainment, Inc., over rights to MGA’s popular Bratz dolls. Carter Bryant, an onagain/off-again Mattel employee, designed the Bratz dolls and pitched them to MGA. A
few months after the pitch, Bryant left Mattel to work at MGA, which began producing
Bratz in 2001. In 2002, Mattel launched an investigation into whether Bryant had
designed the Bratz dolls while employed with Mattel. After two years of investigation,
Mattel sued Bryant. A year later MGA fired off a suit of its own, claiming that Mattel’s
My Scene dolls were an attempt to copy the Bratz line. Mattel answered by expanding
its own lawsuit to include MGA and its CEO, Isaac Larian.
For decades, Barbie had reigned supreme in the doll market. However, Bratz dolls
gave Barbie a run for her money. In 2005, four years after the brand’s debut, Bratz
sales were at $2 billion. By 2009, Barbie’s worldwide sales had fallen by 15 percent,
although Bratz was not immune to sluggish sales either once consumers began to cut
back on spending during the 2008–2009 recession.
Much evidence points toward Bryant having conceived of Bratz dolls while at
Mattel. Four years after the initial suit was filed, Bryant settled with Mattel under an
undisclosed set of terms. However, although some decisions were made, the battle
between Mattel and MGA has continued. In July 2008, a jury deemed MGA and its
CEO liable for what it termed ‘‘intentional interference’’ regarding Bryant’s contract
with Mattel. In August 2008, Mattel received damages of $100 million. Although
Mattel first requested damages of $1.8 billion, the company was pleased with the
principle behind the victory. MGA is appealing the decision.
In December 2008, Mattel appeared to win another victory when a California
judge banned MGA from making or selling Bratz dolls. The decision was devastating
to the Bratz line, as retailers have avoided the brand in anticipation of Mattel’s takeover. 
Many industry analysts, however, expect Mattel to work out a deal with MGA in
which MGA can continue to sell Bratz dolls as long as Mattel shares in the profits.
MGA plans to appeal the court ruling. Whatever the outcome, Mattel has managed to
gain some control over Barbie’s toughest competition.
American Girl
In 1998, Mattel acquired Pleasant Company, maker of the American Girl collection—a
well-known line of historical dolls, books, and accessories. Originally, American Girl
products were sold exclusively through catalogs. Mattel extended that base by selling
American Girl accessories (not the dolls) in major chain stores like Walmart and
Target. More recent efforts to increase brand awareness include the opening of
American Girl Place shops in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Atlanta, Dallas, Boston,
and Minneapolis. The New York store features three floors of dolls, accessories, and
books in the heart of the 5th Avenue shopping district. The store also offers a cafe
where girls can dine with their dolls and a stage production where young actresses
bring American Girl stories to life.
The American Girl collection is wildly popular with girls in the 7- to 12-year-old
demographic. The dolls have a wholesome and educational image—the antithesis to
Barbie. This move by Mattel represented a long-term strategy to reduce reliance on
traditional products and to take away the stigma surrounding the ‘‘perfect image’’ of
Barbie. Each American Girl doll lives during a specific time in American history, and
all have stories that describe the hardships they face while maturing into young adults.
For example, Felicity’s stories describe life in 1774 just prior to the Revolutionary
War. Likewise, Josephina lives in New Mexico in 1824 during the rapid growth of the
American West. Other dolls include Kaya (a Native American girl growing up in
1764), Elizabeth (Colonial Virginia), Kirsten (pioneer life in 1854), Addy (1864
during the Civil War), Samantha and Nellie (1904 New York), Kit (1934 during the
Great Depression), Molly (1944 during World War II), and Emily (a British girl who
comes to America during World War II). The American Girl brand includes several
book series, accessories, clothing for dolls and girls, and a magazine that ranks in the
top 10 American children’s magazines.
Hot Wheels
Hot Wheels roared into the toy world in 1968. More than 40 years later, the brand is
hotter than ever and includes high-end collectibles, NASCAR (National Association
for Stock Car Auto Racing) and Formula One models for adults, high-performance
cars, track sets, and play sets for children of all ages. The brand is connected with
racing circuits worldwide. More than 15 million boys ages 5 to 15 are avid
collectors, each owning an average of 41 cars.

What impact did Bratz doll have on Mattel?","Bratz dolls had several impacts on Mattel. The Bratz doll line gained significant market share during the early 2000s, causing Barbie's popularity to slip and giving Barbie ""a run for her money"" (Barbie’s Popularity Slips). By 2009, Barbie's worldwide sales had fallen by 15 percent (Barbie’s Legal Battle with MGA Entertainment).

Mattel also became embroiled in a bitter intellectual property battle with MGA Entertainment, Inc., and former employee Carter Bryant over the rights to Bratz dolls, starting in 2004 (Barbie’s Legal Battle with MGA Entertainment). In August 2008, Mattel received $100 million in damages after a jury deemed MGA and its CEO liable for ""intentional interference"" regarding Bryant's contract with Mattel (Barbie’s Legal Battle with MGA Entertainment). In December 2008, a California judge banned MGA from making or selling Bratz dolls, and Mattel subsequently gained ""some control over Barbie’s toughest competition"" (Barbie’s Legal Battle with MGA Entertainment).","The Bratz doll line had a significant and multifaceted impact on Mattel, primarily affecting its flagship Barbie brand, its market share, and leading to a prolonged legal battle.

Here's a breakdown of the key impacts:

1.  **Market Share Loss and Decline in Barbie Sales:** Bratz dolls, with their contemporary, ethnic designs and ""skimpy clothes,"" emerged as innovative competition in the early 2000s and became an immediate hit with young girls. This directly contributed to a significant slip in Barbie's popularity and market share. By 2005, Bratz sales reached $2 billion, and by 2009, Barbie's worldwide sales had fallen by a substantial 15 percent.
2.  **Forced Competitive Innovation:** To counter Bratz's success and recover market share, Mattel introduced its own new doll line, **My Scene dolls**. These dolls were specifically aimed at ""tweens"" and were designed to be trendier, look younger, and be more ""hip,"" directly mirroring some of the characteristics that made Bratz popular. This shows Mattel had to adapt its product strategy due to the new competition.
3.  **Bitter Intellectual Property Battle:** The rise of Bratz dolls triggered a lengthy and ""bitter intellectual property battle"" between Mattel and MGA Entertainment (the maker of Bratz), along with former Mattel employee Carter Bryant, who designed the Bratz dolls. Mattel launched an investigation, claiming Bryant designed the dolls while employed by them, leading to a lawsuit against Bryant and later MGA and its CEO.
4.  **Significant Legal Victories and Financial Damages:** Mattel achieved several key legal victories in this battle. In 2008, a jury found MGA and its CEO liable for ""intentional interference"" regarding Bryant's contract with Mattel, awarding Mattel $100 million in damages. Later that year, a California judge issued a ruling that banned MGA from making or selling Bratz dolls, which was devastating for the Bratz brand and led retailers to avoid it.
5.  **Gained Control over Competition:** Ultimately, through its legal efforts, Mattel managed to gain ""some control over Barbie's toughest competition."" While MGA planned to appeal some decisions and industry analysts expected a potential profit-sharing deal, Mattel successfully disrupted the Bratz brand and asserted its intellectual property rights.

In essence, Bratz dolls posed a serious threat to Barbie's long-standing dominance, forcing Mattel to respond both creatively with new products and aggressively through legal action to protect its market position and intellectual property."

Insulin is a small protein composed of 51 amino acids. Because insulin is derived from a living organism, it is considered a biologic, or biological product (the text box below defines biologics and describes their regulatory framework). Since the discovery of insulin, incremental modifications over time have resulted in improvements in safety, effectiveness, and convenience to patients.5

Insulin was discovered in 1921 by two University of Toronto researchers who sold their U.S. patents to the university for $1 each, so the drug could be produced at a reasonable cost.6 Facing challenges manufacturing sufficient quantities of insulin for the North American market, in 1923, the University of Toronto team partnered with—and licensed manufacturing rights to—several pharmaceutical companies.7 

Commercially available insulins today differ from the insulin discovered by the Toronto team. The original insulin was a short-acting product with a duration of action of 6-8 hours, making it less suitable for providing 24-hour coverage. In the late 1930s through the 1950s, researchers altered regular insulin by adding substances (e.g., protamine and zinc) to gain longer action, resulting in what are now called intermediate-acting insulins. One such advance, Neutral Protamine Hagedorn (NPH), was patented in 1946. It allowed for the combination of two types of insulin (long-acting and short-acting insulin) in premixed vials, making a single daily injection possible for some patients.8  

At that time, insulin was obtained by extraction from animals. As animal-derived products, insulins were subject to problems inherent to animal-tissue extracts, such as impurities, which could cause immunologic reactions impacting their safety and effectiveness.9  

Insulin production has changed over the years, as researchers altered insulin to improve the patient experience. In the late 1970s, advancements in biotechnology allowed for the replacement of animal insulin extracted from cattle and pig pancreases with human insulin produced using recombinant DNA technology. In 1982, Eli Lilly brought the first recombinant human insulins to the U.S. market: Humulin R (regular) and N (NPH). In the late 1980s, advancements in recombinant technology allowed scientists to modify insulin’s structure to improve its physiological effects. This advancement resulted in the development of insulin analogs, which more closely replicate normal insulin patterns in the body. In 1996, Humalog (insulin lispro) became the first rapid-acting insulin analog to be approved, followed by Novolog (insulin aspart) in 2000, and others thereafter.10 This same technology allowed for the development of long-acting insulin analogs. In 2000, Lantus (insulin glargine) became the first long-acting insulin analog, and others followed.11  

Some studies have questioned whether the more expensive analogs provide an advantage over regular insulin in controlling glucose levels or preventing diabetes-related complications in patients with type 2 diabetes.12 In addition to modifications to insulin itself, associated delivery devices, such as insulin pens, have provided a more convenient route of administration for patients compared with syringes. Subsequent patenting of these modifications upon approval has shielded insulin products from competition for extended periods. As new insulin products entered the market, insulin manufacturers discontinued many older versions of these products. The regulatory framework created challenges for bringing generic insulins to the market.13 

USER REQUEST:
Please describe modifications to insulin that have resulted in improvements in safety, effectiveness, and convenience to patients. Please describe just one modification that pertains to the three areas listed above.",The provided document does not contain this information.,"One significant modification to insulin that has improved its safety, effectiveness, and convenience for patients is the development of **intermediate-acting insulins**, such as Neutral Protamine Hagedorn (NPH).

Here's how this modification addressed all three areas:

1.  **Effectiveness:** The original insulin was short-acting, lasting only 6-8 hours, which was insufficient for 24-hour coverage. In the late 1930s through the 1950s, researchers altered regular insulin by adding substances like protamine and zinc. This modification successfully extended insulin's duration of action, creating intermediate-acting insulins. NPH, patented in 1946, was a key advance as it allowed for the combination of both long-acting and short-acting insulins in premixed vials, making the therapy much more effective at providing sustained glucose control throughout the day.

2.  **Convenience:** A major benefit of intermediate-acting insulins like NPH was the ability to provide more sustained action. This meant that for some patients, a ""single daily injection"" became possible, significantly reducing the number of injections required compared to the multiple daily doses needed with short-acting insulin. This simplified the treatment regimen and made it much easier for patients to manage their diabetes.

3.  **Safety:** By providing a longer duration of action and enabling more consistent 24-hour coverage, intermediate-acting insulins inherently improved patient safety. Consistent blood glucose control helps prevent dangerous fluctuations (both high and low blood sugar). Furthermore, reducing the frequency of injections, as NPH did for some, can lead to fewer injection site reactions and reduce the potential for dosing errors associated with multiple daily administrations."

One of the main ways in which the economy impacts CRE is via interest rates. Higher interest rates in both the short term and the long term are likely to affect industries that rely on credit, such as CRE.6 Tighter credit conditions can affect the ability of builders to obtain financing for new construction. Higher borrowing costs can in turn reduce CRE growth or increase rents for CRE occupants. If CRE owners ultimately cannot make payments on higher cost loans, this could result in losses for those individuals and institutions that finance CRE. In recent years, interest rates rose significantly, one of several fundamental shifts in the economic environment. Prior to the pandemic, inflation was low and stable despite over a decade of historically low interest rates and accommodative monetary policy.7 This led to low borrowing costs. However, inflation began rising in 2021, reaching highs not seen since the 1980s, and interest rates have also risen significantly. In response to inflation, the Federal Reserve (Fed) raised the federal funds rate (FFR) over five percentage points between March 2022 and July 2023.8 Other interest rates in the economy responded to the Fed’s actions, resulting in a higher interest rate environment and higher borrowing costs. The Fed has yet to begin lowering rates but is expected to begin lowering rates in late 2024. The Fed projects that the appropriate monetary policy path will result in an FFR of 2.8% in the longer run—relatively low in historical terms but higher than most of the period since the 2007-2009 financial crisis and recession.9 CRE is also likely to be affected by other economic conditions, including demand and investment behavior. Despite the Fed’s efforts to reduce demand through interest rate hikes, the economy has remained unexpectedly robust in the face of monetary tightening particularly with respect to metrics that could affect CRE, such as consumer spending and labor market conditions. While monetary tightening has weighed somewhat on investment, including residential investment (which includes multifamily CRE properties), consumer spending has been strong, which could help retail CRE properties. Overall, the labor market closed out 2023 relatively strong with unemployment at 3.7%, and economic growth largely beat expectations in 2023 at 2.5% for the year. 10 While the first quarter of 2024 did show an increase in the unemployment rate, higher than-anticipated inflation, and slower growth, the economy remains in relatively good condition, with growth at a strong 3.0% in the second quarter. A continued strong economic performance could help buoy CRE markets despite higher borrowing costs. Economic Outlook for CRE Since the Fed began raising rates in response to high inflation in March 2022, it has been trying to achieve a soft landing—a return to low inflation while maintaining moderate economic growth and full employment.11 Achieving a soft landing after sustained monetary policy tightening is notoriously difficult. Historically, most periods of sustained tightening have been followed by hard landings, meaning recessions. Nonetheless, the recent period of monetary policy tightening has so far resulted in falling inflation without a significant decline in employment or economic activity. A soft landing would be advantageous to CRE, as it would be to all sectors of the economy. All else equal, low and stable inflation, moderate growth, and a strong labor market would lead to robust and sustainable demand, including consumer spending and business investment. A hard landing would lead to lower demand and likely lower CRE growth. In terms of CRE, the path of interest rates may be of particular policy interest given the role they play in CRE. In the projected scenario of a soft landing, interest rates are likely to decrease beginning this year. As of June 2024, the Fed’s Federal Open Market Committee projected that one rate decrease in the second half of 2024 would be appropriate, with the median projected appropriate policy path resulting in an FFR of 5.1% at the end of 2024, 4.1% at the end of 2025, and 3.1% at the end of 2026.12 In August 2024, Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated that “the time has come for policy to adjust,” indicating likely rate cuts beginning in September 2024.13 However, changes in the FFR are unlikely to affect longer-term interest rates by the same magnitude. For example, an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development model for long-term interest rates forecasts that the rate on a 10-year government security will be 3.9% in the third quarter of 2025.14 The yield on a 10-year Treasury as of July 2, 2024, was 4.43%.15 Easing credit conditions could boost construction and CRE growth generally, although there is a high degree of uncertainty about how much interest rates will ultimately fall. While most economists are not predicting an imminent recession, it is possible that one could occur nonetheless. For example, the recent increases in the unemployment rate have some concerned that the economy is weakening.16 In this scenario, the Fed may opt to lower the FFR either more quickly or by a larger magnitude than it may otherwise have done. Such an economic contraction would likely hurt CRE growth, but the monetary response would help it to recover, all else equal. Structural Changes Affecting CRE Properties While certain broad economic conditions may be expected to affect CRE broadly, the impacts can look quite different based on type. For example, COVID-19 was a shock to all CRE segments as well as the broader economy. However, based on the nature of the pandemic, demand for office or retail space took relatively big hits, as restrictions on in-person contact made spending in brick and-mortar stores difficult and resulted in increased telework. 17 While the performance of CRE sectors has largely been mixed, the office sector in particular is continuing to show signs of stress and has the highest potential to cause stress in the banking sector. For example, while vacancy rates are up since pre-pandemic for multifamily and retail, they are elevated to a lesser degree than in the office sector, which shows record-level vacancy rates. In the industrial sector, vacancy rates have fallen since the beginning of the pandemic. Other metrics, such as rents, tell a less consistent story across sectors over this period. Nonetheless, as of the second quarter of 2024, quarterly effective rent growth was positive in all sectors apart from office.18 The Office Sector The pandemic resulted in a structural shift away from in-office work, resulting in high vacancy rates for this segment of CRE that persist today. With the rise in telework, many companies renting space from the office subsector of CRE owners are not renewing their leases. This is evidenced by higher office vacancy rates (see Figure 1), which continue to rise, hitting a record 20.1% in the second quarter of 2024, according to Moody’s Analytics, a credit rating agency. 19 Consequently, the number of office property rental leases has declined, generating lower revenues and potentially imperiling the ability of the property owners to pay back financing costs. According to Moody’s, effective rents have been negative or largely unchanged for the four quarters ending in Q2 2024 (see Figure 1).20 To minimize losses, some CRE owners have been willing to break leases and renegotiate terms with tenants. 21 Further, while norms surrounding remote and hybrid work have shifted in the past few years owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, the extent to which remote work will shift the CRE landscape is uncertain. While rates of office utilization are lower than prior to the pandemic (i.e., February 2020), according to some estimates, they have, on average, trended upward in selected major cities after the initial onset (i.e., March 2020) of the pandemic (see Figure 2).

List every influence of the pandemic in a bullet list, using only three sentences for each point.","Here are the influences of the pandemic:

*   COVID-19 was a shock to all Commercial Real Estate (CRE) segments as well as the broader economy (17). Based on the nature of the pandemic, demand for office or retail space took relatively big hits (17). This was because restrictions on in-person contact made spending in brick-and-mortar stores difficult and resulted in increased telework (17).
*   The pandemic resulted in a structural shift away from in-office work (19). This shift led to high vacancy rates for the office segment of CRE that persist today (19). Office vacancy rates continue to rise, hitting a record 20.1% in the second quarter of 2024 (19).
*   With the rise in telework, many companies renting space from the office subsector of CRE owners are not renewing their leases (19). The number of office property rental leases has consequently declined (19). This generates lower revenues and potentially imperils the ability of property owners to pay back financing costs (19).
*   While the performance of CRE sectors has largely been mixed since the pandemic, vacancy rates have shown different trends across sectors (19). Vacancy rates are up since pre-pandemic for multifamily and retail, although to a lesser degree than in the office sector (19). In contrast, vacancy rates in the industrial sector have fallen since the beginning of the pandemic (19).","The COVID-19 pandemic significantly influenced various aspects of the economy and Commercial Real Estate (CRE), causing both immediate and lasting changes. Here's a breakdown of its key influences:

*   **Shift in Inflation and Interest Rates**
    Prior to the pandemic, inflation was low and stable, supported by historically low interest rates and accommodative monetary policy. However, inflation began rising significantly in 2021, reaching levels not seen since the 1980s. This surge in inflation prompted the Federal Reserve to drastically raise the federal funds rate, resulting in a higher interest rate environment and increased borrowing costs across the economy.

*   **Broad Shock to CRE and the Economy**
    The pandemic delivered a substantial shock to both the broader economy and all segments of Commercial Real Estate. This widespread disruption introduced significant uncertainty and impacted established market conditions across various industries. Its immediate effects created a complex environment that necessitated swift adaptations from businesses and policymakers alike.

*   **Reduced Demand for Office and Retail Space**
    Based on its nature, the pandemic significantly impacted demand for office and retail spaces due to restrictions on in-person contact. These restrictions made spending in brick-and-mortar stores difficult and led to a rapid increase in telework adoption. Consequently, these changes directly contributed to elevated vacancy rates and reduced foot traffic in these particular CRE sectors.

*   **Differentiated Impact Across CRE Sectors**
    The pandemic resulted in a mixed performance across various Commercial Real Estate sectors, with differing levels of impact. The office sector, in particular, continues to show severe stress with record-level vacancy rates, posing a potential risk to the banking sector. In contrast, while retail and multifamily also saw increased vacancies compared to pre-pandemic, the industrial sector experienced falling vacancy rates, indicating varied resilience.

*   **Structural Shift Away from In-Office Work**
    The pandemic caused a fundamental and structural shift away from traditional in-office work environments towards telework and hybrid models. This paradigm change led many companies to either not renew leases or reduce their physical office footprint. Consequently, the office subsector of CRE experienced declines in rental leases and revenue, creating lasting challenges.

*   **Persistent Lower Office Utilization**
    Office utilization rates have remained consistently lower than levels observed prior to the pandemic, specifically February 2020. While some major cities have seen a modest upward trend in utilization since the initial onset of the pandemic, a full recovery to pre-pandemic norms has not occurred. This ongoing reduction in physical office presence continues to challenge the financial viability and demand for office Commercial Real Estate."

 Takeaway
 Some research suggests that xylitol toothpaste may benefit your teeth, such as preventing cavities. However, research is mixed. More studies are needed to fully support its dental health benefits.
 

 Xylitol is a sugar alcohol. Although it occursTrusted Source naturally in some fruits, it’s considered an artificial sweetener.
 

 Some research suggests that xylitol may have several dental benefits.
 

 However, the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry (AAPD) doesn’t support using xylitol toothpaste because there isn’t enough research on its effectiveness for dental health, and the current research is mixed.
 

 Keep reading to learn more about the possible dental health benefits and side effects of xylitol toothpaste, as well as how to use it.
 

 Xylitol and dental health benefits
 Xylitol may be an effective defenseTrusted Source against the bacteria Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans). This type of cariogenic, or cavity-causing, bacteria is a key contributor to tooth decay and enamel breakdown.
 

 Sugar serves as food for the cariogenic bacteria that live in your mouth. When those bacteria feed on fermentable sugars, they produce lactic acid that damages tooth enamel. This damage can eventually lead to cavities.
 

 Xylitol is an unfermentable sugar alcohol that the bacteria can’t process. That means no lactic acid is produced to damage the enamel.
 

 Xylitol may also help prevent dental plaque, which may lead to cavities.
 

 Benefits of xylitol toothpaste
 Several studies have found that xylitol toothpaste may be an effective delivery system for xylitol. However, the research is mixed on how much xylitol is needed to experience notable benefits.
 

 For instance, a 2023 study found that using 25% xylitol toothpaste twice daily for 24 months significantly reduced levels of S. mutans in the mouth. The researchers concluded that xylitol toothpaste may be an effective home remedy for preventing cavities.
 

 A 2024 studyTrusted Source found similar results when using 25% xylitol toothpaste twice daily for 3 months, while a 2022 reviewTrusted Source found that products containing xylitol, such as chewing gum and toothpaste, helped prevent cavities.
 

 On the other hand, the AAPD found that taking xylitol less than three times daily had no protective effects, which differs from the positive results above.
 

 However, the AAPD did note that consuming 5 to 10 grams (g) of xylitol three times daily may help reduce cavities by up to 80%.

 Xylitol toothpaste vs. fluoride toothpaste
 Research comparing xylitol toothpaste and fluoride toothpaste is limited.
 

 A small 2018 studyTrusted Source found that fluoride toothpaste was more effective at reducing S. mutans than xylitol toothpaste.
 

 Some xylitol proponents suggest that it’s more effective when combined with fluoride in toothpaste. Xylitol helps protect the teeth from damage, and fluoride helps repair any damage that the teeth might sustain.
 

 A 2015 reviewTrusted Source of 10 studies compared fluoride toothpaste to fluoride toothpaste with 10% xylitol added.
 

 When children used xylitol-fluoride toothpaste for 2.5 to 3 years, their cavities were reduced by an additional 13%. That said, the evidence was deemed to be of low quality.
 

 However, a 2014 studyTrusted Source found no significant difference in tooth decay reduction between children using xylitol-fluoride toothpaste and those using fluoride-only toothpaste.
 

 More research is needed to compare the effects of fluoride and xylitol toothpaste.
 

 Xylitol toothpaste for children
 Some studies have found that xylitol toothpaste may be an effective strategy for reducing cavities in kids.
 

 The AAPD has endorsed xylitol as part of a complete strategy to prevent tooth decay or cavities. However, due to mixed and limited research, the AAPD doesn’t recommend using xylitol toothpaste for children.
 

 Xylitol chewing gum and candy
 According to the AAPD, some research has found that chewing may enhance xylitol’s anti-cariogenic, or anti-tooth decay, effect.
 

 This means that chewing gum, lozenges, and candies may be more effective at preventing cavities than toothpaste.
 

 A 2014 study also found that erythritol candy was significantly more effective at reducing cavities than xylitol candy.
 

 However, more research is needed.
 

 How much xylitol you need
 The research on how much xylitol you need per day is mixed.
 

 For instance, a 2014 review suggests that a daily dose of 6 to 10 gTrusted Source could help prevent carries.
 

 However, the AAPD notes that three daily doses of 5 to 10 g, for a daily total of 15 to 30 g, are needed to experience dental benefits.
 

 Side effects of xylitol
 Xylitol is digested slowly in the large intestine. This may result in its primary side effects, which may include:
 

 flatulence
 diarrhea
 more frequent bowel movements
 It’s also important to note that xylitol is especially toxic to dogs. If your dog eats xylitol toothpaste — or xylitol in any form — take them to the veterinarian immediately.
 

 Make sure to bring along the packaging from the xylitol product for the vet’s reference.
 

 Frequently asked questions
 Is xylitol toothpaste good for your teeth?
 Some research suggests xylitol toothpaste could help reduce plaque buildup and bacteria that may lead to cavities. However, more research is needed.
 

 Is there xylitol in Crest toothpaste?
 Some types of Crest toothpaste may have xylitol, such as Crest 3D white. However, if you want xylitol in your toothpaste, it’s best to read the labels because not all toothpaste contains xylitol.
 

 

 The bottom line
 Xylitol is a sugar replacement that could help prevent cavities and tooth decay. Some research suggests that xylitol toothpaste may have a significant impact on cavity prevention.
 

 However, toothpaste may not be the most effective delivery system for xylitol.
 

 If you’re considering switching to a toothpaste with xylitol, speak with a dentist first. They could help you decide whether it’s right for you and provide suggestions to help you prevent cavities.
 

 This may include modifying your oral hygiene routine and recommending regular visits to the dentist.

I bought my kids some new toothpaste and it contains the ingredient xylitol. I want to know more about what that is so I found this article. Please explain what xylitol is and what benefits it has. Use at least 400 words in your response.","Xylitol is defined as a sugar alcohol that occurs naturally in some fruits, although it is considered an artificial sweetener [1].

Some research suggests that xylitol may have several dental benefits, with some studies indicating it could help prevent cavities and tooth decay [1]. Specifically, xylitol may be an effective defense against the bacteria *Streptococcus mutans* (S. mutans) [1]. This bacteria is recognized as a cariogenic, or cavity-causing, type that is a key contributor to tooth decay and the breakdown of tooth enamel [1]. Sugar typically serves as food for cariogenic bacteria in the mouth; when these bacteria feed on fermentable sugars, they produce lactic acid, which damages tooth enamel and can eventually lead to cavities [1]. Xylitol, however, is an unfermentable sugar alcohol that these bacteria cannot process, meaning it does not lead to the production of lactic acid that damages enamel [1]. Additionally, xylitol may help prevent dental plaque, which can also contribute to cavities [1].

Regarding xylitol toothpaste specifically, several studies have indicated that it may serve as an effective delivery system for xylitol [1]. However, the research is mixed concerning the exact amount of xylitol needed to achieve notable benefits [1]. For example, a 2023 study observed that using 25% xylitol toothpaste twice daily for 24 months significantly reduced levels of S. mutans in the mouth [1]. The researchers concluded from this study that xylitol toothpaste could be an effective home remedy for preventing cavities [1].

In contrast, a 2014 study found no significant difference in tooth decay reduction between children using xylitol-fluoride toothpaste and those using fluoride-only toothpaste [1]. More research is needed to thoroughly compare the effects of fluoride and xylitol toothpaste [1].

For children, some studies have suggested that xylitol toothpaste could be an effective strategy for reducing cavities [1]. The AAPD has endorsed xylitol as a component of a comprehensive strategy for preventing tooth decay or cavities [1]. Nevertheless, due to the mixed and limited nature of the research, the AAPD does not recommend the use of xylitol toothpaste for children [1].

Other forms of xylitol delivery have also been explored. According to the AAPD, some research suggests that the act of chewing may enhance xylitol's anti-cariogenic, or anti-tooth decay, effect [1]. This implies that chewing gum, lozenges, and candies containing xylitol might be more effective at preventing cavities than toothpaste [1]. A 2014 study also found that erythritol candy was significantly more effective at reducing cavities than xylitol candy, though more research in this area is needed [1].

The optimal daily intake of xylitol for dental benefits is also a subject of mixed research [1]. A 2014 review suggests that a daily dose of 6 to 10 g could help prevent caries [1]. However, the AAPD notes that three daily doses of 5 to 10 g, summing to a daily total of 15 to 30 g, are required to experience dental benefits [1].

While generally considered beneficial for dental health, it is important to note that xylitol is digested slowly in the large intestine, which may lead to side effects such as flatulence, diarrhea, and more frequent bowel movements [1]. It is also critical to be aware that xylitol is extremely toxic to dogs; if a dog ingests xylitol in any form, including toothpaste, immediate veterinary attention is necessary, and the product packaging should be brought for the vet's reference [1].

It also concludes that although some research suggests xylitol toothpaste may have a significant impact on cavity prevention, toothpaste might not be the most effective delivery system for xylitol [1]. If considering a switch to xylitol toothpaste, it is recommended to consult with a dentist first to determine if it is suitable and for advice on cavity prevention [1].","It's wonderful that you're looking into the ingredients in your children's toothpaste to understand them better! Xylitol is a fascinating ingredient that's been gaining attention in oral hygiene, and your article provides some great insights into what it is and its potential benefits.

Let's break down what xylitol is and what it might do for your kids' teeth.

**What is Xylitol?**

First off, xylitol is classified as a **sugar alcohol**. While it does occur naturally in some fruits and vegetables, it's often used as an artificial sweetener. Don't let the ""sugar alcohol"" part confuse you; it doesn't contain ethanol like alcoholic beverages. Instead, its chemical structure shares characteristics with both sugar and alcohol.

Now, for its role in dental health, here's where it gets really interesting: our mouths are home to many different kinds of bacteria, and some of them, like *Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans)*, are the primary culprits behind cavities. These cavity-causing bacteria thrive on the fermentable sugars we eat, converting them into lactic acid. It's this lactic acid that then erodes tooth enamel, eventually leading to tooth decay and cavities.

Xylitol acts differently because it's an **unfermentable sugar alcohol**. This means that the harmful *S. mutans* bacteria cannot process or ""eat"" xylitol. Since they can't metabolize it, they don't produce the damaging lactic acid that typically breaks down tooth enamel. Essentially, xylitol starves these bad bacteria, preventing them from creating the acidic environment that leads to cavities. Beyond that, some research also suggests that xylitol may help prevent dental plaque, another major contributor to cavities.

**What are the Benefits of Xylitol, Especially in Toothpaste?**

The potential dental health benefits of xylitol are quite promising, particularly when it comes to preventing cavities and fighting off harmful bacteria.

1.  **Cavity Prevention:** As mentioned, xylitol's main benefit stems from its ability to inhibit *S. mutans* from producing enamel-damaging acid. By disrupting this process, it acts as a defense against tooth decay. Some studies, like those from 2023 and 2024 cited in your article, have shown that using toothpaste with 25% xylitol twice daily significantly reduced levels of *S. mutans* in the mouth, suggesting it could be an effective home remedy for preventing cavities. A 2022 review also supported that products containing xylitol, including toothpaste, helped prevent cavities.

2.  **Plaque Reduction:** In addition to its anti-bacterial effects, xylitol may also help to prevent the buildup of dental plaque, which is a sticky film of bacteria that contributes to cavities and gum disease.

3.  **Effectiveness in Toothpaste (with nuances):** Your article highlights that while several studies suggest xylitol toothpaste can be an effective delivery system, the research on how much xylitol is needed for notable benefits is ""mixed."" This is an important distinction. For instance, while some studies show positive results with specific concentrations (like 25% xylitol), the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry (AAPD) notes that taking xylitol less than three times daily had no protective effects. The AAPD suggests that consuming 5 to 10 grams of xylitol three times a day (totaling 15 to 30 grams daily) may reduce cavities by up to 80%. Whether standard toothpaste usage consistently delivers this amount is something to consider.

4.  **Combined with Fluoride:** Some proponents believe that xylitol is even more effective when combined with fluoride in toothpaste. The idea is that xylitol helps protect teeth from damage by reducing harmful bacteria, while fluoride helps repair any existing damage or strengthen enamel. A 2015 review looking at children using xylitol-fluoride toothpaste found an additional 13% reduction in cavities, though the evidence quality was low. However, another 2014 study found no significant difference between xylitol-fluoride and fluoride-only toothpaste. So, the jury is still somewhat out on the synergistic effect.

**Xylitol for Children:**

For kids specifically, some studies have found xylitol to be an effective strategy for reducing cavities. The AAPD acknowledges xylitol's potential and endorses it as part of a *complete strategy* to prevent tooth decay. However, it's crucial to note that due to mixed and limited research on *xylitol toothpaste specifically*, the AAPD does not currently recommend its sole use for children. They are more supportive of xylitol delivered through methods like chewing gum, lozenges, and candies, where the extended chewing action may enhance its anti-cavity effects.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Mixed Research:** The key takeaway from your article is that while promising, the research on xylitol toothpaste, especially for children, is still ""mixed"" and ""more studies are needed"" to fully establish its benefits and optimal usage.
*   **Daily Intake:** There's also mixed guidance on the ideal daily intake. Some reviews suggest 6 to 10 grams daily, while the AAPD suggests a higher 15 to 30 grams daily divided into three doses.
*   **Consult Your Dentist:** Given the nuances, it's always a good idea to speak with your family dentist. They can offer personalized advice based on your children's specific dental health needs and help you decide if a xylitol-containing toothpaste is the right choice as part of their overall oral hygiene routine.

In summary, xylitol is a sugar alcohol that shows promise in fighting cavity-causing bacteria by preventing acid production. While some studies support its use in toothpaste for reducing cavities, particularly for children, the overall research is still developing, and organizations like the AAPD have cautious recommendations. It's a beneficial ingredient, but perhaps best understood as one component in a comprehensive approach to good oral health, alongside fluoride, proper brushing, and regular dental visits."

How Technology Is Changing the Way Children Think and Focus
 Are your children prepared to think and focus for success in 21st-century life?
 Posted December 4, 2012 | Reviewed by Lybi Ma
 Key points
 Attention is a highly malleable quality and most directly influenced by the environment in which it is used.
 The internet creates a learning environment in which consistent attention is impossible, imagination is unnecessary, and memory is inhibited.
 Video games improve visual-spatial capabilities, increase attentional ability, reaction times, and the ability to identify details among clutter.
 Thinking. The capacity to reflect, reason, and draw conclusions based on our experiences, knowledge, and insights. It’s what makes us human and has enabled us to communicate, create, build, advance, and become civilized. Thinking encompasses so many aspects of who our children are and what they do, from observing, learning, remembering, questioning, and judging to innovating, arguing, deciding, and acting.
 There is also little doubt that all of the new technologies, led by the internet, are shaping the way we think in ways obvious and subtle, deliberate and unintentional, and advantageous and detrimental The uncertain reality is that, with this new technological frontier in its infancy and developments emerging at a rapid pace, we have neither the benefit of historical hindsight nor the time to ponder or examine the value and cost of these advancements in terms of how it influences our children’s ability to think.
 There is, however, a growing body of research that technology can be both beneficial and harmful to different ways in which children think. Moreover, this influence isn’t just affecting children on the surface of their thinking. Rather, because their brains are still developing and malleable, frequent exposure by so-called digital natives to technology is actually wiring the brain in ways very different than in previous generations.
 What is clear is that, as with advances throughout history, the technology that is available determines how our brains develop. For example, as the technology writer Nicholas Carr has observed, the emergence of reading encouraged our brains to be focused and imaginative. In contrast, the rise of the internet is strengthening our ability to scan information rapidly and efficiently.
 The effects of technology on children are complicated, with both benefits and costs. Whether technology helps or hurts in the development of your children’s thinking depends on what specific technology is used and how and what frequency it is used. At least early in their lives, the power to dictate your children’s relationship with technology and, as a result, its influence on them, from synaptic activity to conscious thought.
 Over the next several weeks, I’m going to focus on the areas in which the latest thinking and research has shown technology to have the greatest influence on how children think: attention, information overload, decision making, and memory/learning. Importantly, all of these areas are ones in which you can have a counteracting influence on how technology affects your children.
 Attention
 You can think of attention as the gateway to thinking. Without it, other aspects of thinking, namely, perception, memory, language, learning, creativity, reasoning, problem-solving, and decision making are greatly diminished or can’t occur at all. The ability of your children to learn to focus effectively and consistently lays the foundation for almost all aspects of their growth and is fundamental to their development into successful and happy people.
 Attention has been found to be a highly malleable quality and most directly influenced by the environment in which it is used. This selective attention can be found in the animal kingdom in which different species develop attentional skills that help them function and survive. For example, wolves, lions, tigers, and other predators have highly tuned visual attention that enables them to spot and track their prey. In contrast, their prey, including deer and antelope, have well-developed auditory attention that allows them to hear approaching predators. In both cases, animals’ attentional abilities have developed based on the environment in which they live.
 The same holds true for human development. Whether infant recognition of their parents’ faces or students paying attention in class, children’s immediate environment determines the kind of attention that they develop. In generations past, for example, children directed considerable amounts of their time to reading, an activity that offered few distractions and required intense and sustained attention, imagination, and memory. The advent of television altered that attention by offering children visual stimuli, fragmented attention, and little need for imagination. Then the internet was invented and children were thrust into a vastly different environment in which, because distraction is the norm, consistent attention is impossible, imagination is unnecessary, and memory is inhibited.
 Technology conditions the brain to pay attention to information very differently than reading. The metaphor that Nicholas Carr uses is the difference between scuba diving and jet skiing. Book reading is like scuba diving in which the diver is submerged in a quiet, visually restricted, slow-paced setting with few distractions and, as a result, is required to focus narrowly and think deeply on the limited information that is available to them. In contrast, using the internet is like jet skiing, in which the jet skier is skimming along the surface of the water at high speed, exposed to a broad vista, surrounded by many distractions, and only able to focus fleetingly on any one thing.
 In fact, studies have shown that reading uninterrupted text results in faster completion and better understanding, recall, and learning than those who read text filled with hyperlinks and ads. Those who read a text-only version of a presentation, as compared to one that included video, found the presentation to be more engaging, informative, and entertaining, a finding contrary to conventional wisdom, to be sure. Additionally, contrary to conventional educational wisdom, students who were allowed internet access during class didn’t recall the lecture nor did they perform as well on a test of the material as those who weren’t “wired” during class. Finally, reading develops reflection, critical thinking, problem-solving, and vocabulary better than visual media.
 Exposure to technology isn’t all bad. Research shows that, for example, video games and other screen media improve visual-spatial capabilities, increase attentional ability, reaction times, and the capacity to identify details among clutter. Also, rather than making children stupid, it may just be making them different. For example, the ubiquitous use of internet search engines is causing children to become less adept at remembering things and more skilled at remembering where to find things. Given the ease with which information can be found these days, it only stands to reason that knowing where to look is becoming more important for children than actually knowing something. Not having to retain information in our brain may allow it to engage in more “higher-order” processing such as contemplation, critical thinking, and problem-solving.
 What does all this mean for raising your children? The bottom line is that too much screen time and not enough other activities, such as reading, playing games, and good old unstructured and imaginative play, will result in your children having their brains wired in ways that may make them less, not more, prepared to thrive in this crazy new world of technology.

Compare how technology has affected children's attention space to how reading affects it. What are the technological advances that negatively shifted the way children's attention span works? Also what are some that positively affects attention span? Give me no more than 750 words.","Reading encouraged children's brains to be focused and imaginative, requiring intense and sustained attention, imagination, and memory (How Technology Is Changing the Way Children Think and Focus). Book reading is compared to scuba diving, where a diver is submerged in a quiet, visually restricted, slow-paced setting with few distractions, necessitating a narrow focus and deep thought on limited information (How Technology Is Changing the Way Children Think and Focus). Studies indicate that reading uninterrupted text leads to faster completion and better understanding, recall, and learning compared to text with hyperlinks and ads (How Technology Is Changing the Way Children Think and Focus). Reading also develops reflection, critical thinking, problem-solving, and vocabulary more effectively than visual media (How Technology Is Changing the Way Children Think and Focus).

In contrast, technology, particularly the internet, shapes attention differently (How Technology Is Changing the Way Children Think and Focus). The rise of the internet strengthens the ability to scan information rapidly and efficiently (How Technology Is Changing the Way Children Think and Focus). Using the internet is likened to jet skiing, where one skims the surface at high speed, exposed to a broad vista, surrounded by many distractions, and can only focus fleetingly on any one thing (How Technology Is Changing the Way Children Think and Focus).

The technological advances that negatively shifted children's attention span include:
*   **Television:** The advent of television altered attention by providing visual stimuli, fragmented attention, and reduced need for imagination (How Technology Is Changing the Way Children Think and Focus).
*   **The Internet:** The internet creates a learning environment where consistent attention is impossible, imagination is unnecessary, and memory is inhibited because distraction is the norm (How Technology Is Changing the Way Children Think and Focus). Reading text filled with hyperlinks and ads results in less understanding, recall, and learning compared to uninterrupted text (How Technology Is Changing the Way Children Think and Focus). Additionally, students with internet access during class did not recall lectures or perform as well on tests as those without internet access (How Technology Is Changing the Way Children Think and Focus).

Conversely, some technological advances have been shown to positively affect attention span:
*   **Video games and other screen media:** Research indicates that video games and other screen media improve visual-spatial capabilities, increase attentional ability, enhance reaction times, and boost the capacity to identify details among clutter (How Technology Is Changing the Way Children Think and Focus).","It's a fascinating and increasingly relevant question to explore how technology is shaping our children's attention spans, especially when compared to traditional activities like reading! The document highlights that attention is a highly adaptable quality, profoundly influenced by the environment we're in, and this applies directly to the digital age.

Let's break down the differences and the specific technologies at play.

### How Reading Shapes Attention

Historically, reading has been a cornerstone for developing a focused and sustained attention span. When children dedicate time to reading, they enter an environment with **few distractions**, requiring them to engage in **intense and sustained attention**. This deep immersion also nurtures imagination and memory, as they visualize the narrative and retain information. The document uses a great metaphor: reading is like **scuba diving**. You're submerged in a quiet, visually restricted, slow-paced setting, forcing you to focus narrowly and think deeply about limited information.

Studies support this, showing that reading uninterrupted text leads to faster completion, better understanding, recall, and learning compared to text riddled with hyperlinks and ads. Reading also actively develops reflection, critical thinking, problem-solving skills, and vocabulary, all of which benefit from a focused mind.

### How Technology Impacts Attention (The Negative Shifts)

The advent of certain technologies has undeniably shifted the way children's attention spans operate, often leading to a more fragmented and rapid style of processing information.

**Technological advances that have negatively shifted attention:**

1.  **The Internet:** This is presented as the primary driver of negative shifts. The internet creates a learning environment where **consistent attention is almost impossible** because distraction is the norm. It encourages ""jet skiing"" – skimming along the surface at high speed, exposed to a broad vista, surrounded by many distractions, and only able to focus fleetingly on any one thing. Hyperlinks, ads, pop-ups, and the constant novelty of new tabs and notifications all contribute to this fragmented experience. Research indicates that students with internet access during lectures recall less and perform worse on tests than those who are ""unwired."" The continuous stream of diverse stimuli means imagination is less necessary, and memory can be inhibited because information is always just a click away.
2.  **Television:** Even before the internet, television altered attention by offering constant visual stimuli. While engaging, it often promoted a more **fragmented attention** span and required little need for active imagination compared to reading, where the mind must create the imagery.
3.  **General ""Screen Time"" Imbalance:** The document emphasizes that *too much screen time* without enough balance from other activities like reading, unstructured play, and imaginative engagement can wire children's brains in ways that make them less, rather than more, prepared for success. This isn't just about the *type* of technology but also the *frequency and duration* of its use.

### How Technology Positively Affects Attention

It's not all doom and gloom! The document also points out that technology isn't unilaterally detrimental; it can foster different, and sometimes beneficial, attentional skills.

**Technological advances that positively affect attention:**

1.  **Video Games and Other Screen Media:** Research shows these can significantly **improve visual-spatial capabilities**. They also lead to an **increase in attentional ability** in specific ways, enhancing reaction times and the capacity to identify details among clutter. Think about a complex strategy game or a fast-paced action game – they demand sharp focus on multiple elements, quick processing, and rapid decision-making within a dynamic visual environment.
2.  **Internet Search Engines (Indirectly):** While the internet can hinder memory for facts, the ubiquitous use of search engines is causing children to become less adept at *remembering things* but more skilled at *remembering where to find things*. This shift might sound negative at first, but the document suggests a compelling upside: not having to retain every piece of information in our brains could free up cognitive resources for ""higher-order"" processing such as contemplation, critical thinking, and problem-solving. Knowing *how to access* information effectively becomes a critical skill, allowing the brain to focus on analyzing, synthesizing, and creating rather than mere rote memorization.

In essence, technology is creating a generation whose brains are wired differently. While it might make sustained, deep focus challenging for some, it simultaneously enhances other crucial skills like rapid information processing, visual discernment, and strategic navigation of vast data landscapes. The key, as always, lies in finding a healthy balance and guiding children to leverage the benefits while mitigating the potential drawbacks."

Treatment
 Before starting treatment, it is important to identify the target outcomes to guide the therapy decision. Drug treatment should be based on a thorough assessment and should always be part of a comprehensive treatment plan that includes psychosocial, behavioural, and educational advice and interventions. Psychotherapy combined with medication may play a role in treating behavioural problems, organisational issues and psychiatric comorbidities [57]. In Italy, an ADHD diagnosis can only be made at a regional referral centre approved by the Italian Ministry of Health. Treatment guidelines put forward by the Ministry of Health and based on European guidelines, specify that pharmacological treatment can only be initiated after failure of cognitive behavioural therapy over a period of 6 months or longer has been demonstrated. Patients must first be enrolled in the ADHD medication registry before treatment with MPH or atomoxetine (ATX) can be prescribed.
 

 Behavioural therapy and pharmacological treatment have both been shown to benefit ADHD patients. A longitudinal study of the efficacy of different treatments (an intensively monitored medication program, behavioural therapy, combination of medication and behavioural therapy or treatment as usual by community care) showed after 8-year follow-up that all four of the original treatment groups had a similar outcome: all showed improvement in comparison with pretreatment baseline scores, but none demonstrated superiority [58].
 

 The fronto-subcortical circuits (lateral prefrontal cortex, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, caudate, and putamen) associated with ADHD are rich in catecholamines, which are involved in the mechanism of action of medications used to treat this disorder. Neuropharmacological studies have provided evidence that ADHD involves dysregulation of both noradrenaline (NE) and DA neurotransmitter systems [59]. MPH treatment causes an increase in DA signalling through multiple actions, including blockade of the DA reuptake transporter, amplification of DA response duration, disinhibition of the dopamine D2 receptor and amplification of DA tone [60]. MPH is also an inhibitor of NE re-uptake. ATX is a selective inhibitor of synaptic re-uptake, and in vivo, it specifically increases extracellular levels of DA in the prefrontal cortex but not in the striatum; probably by modulating cortical synaptic DA uptake via the NE transporter [61]. Dextroamphetamine increases the synaptic activity of DA and NE by increasing the release of the neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft, decreasing reuptake back into the presynaptic neuron, and inhibiting their catabolism [62]. Strong evidence exists indicating that stimulant medications, such as MPH and dextroamphetamine, and the non-stimulant ATX, are effective in improving ADHD symptoms [63]. Guanfacine is a selective alpha2A adrenergic receptor agonist, which improves working memory by stimulating postsynaptic alpha2A adrenoceptors, strengthening the functional connectivity of prefrontal cortex networks [64]. Guanfacine has also been shown to be effective in reducing ADHD symptoms [65, 66]. Table 1 summarises the most important characteristics of these pharmacological treatments for ADHD. Only ATX and immediate release MPH are currently approved for the treatment of ADHD in Italy.
 

 Table 1 Clinical characteristics of ADHD pharmacotherapies
 Full size table
 ADHD pharmacological therapies are generally well-tolerated (Table 1). However, concerns surrounding the cardiovascular safety of some of these drugs has prompted a recent examination of the effects of ATX and MPH on blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), and ECG parameters. MPH appears to cause minor increases in BP and HR, with no strong data to suggest that itincreases the QT interval. Limited data suggest that ATX may increase BP and HR in the short term; in the long term it appears to only increase BP. The effects of ATX on QT interval remain uncertain. Because the current evidence is based on research that has not been specifically designed to investigate the cardiovascular effects of these drugs, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions [67].
 

 Both MPH and ATX significantly increase activation in key cortical and subcortical regions subserving attention and executive functions. Therefore, alterations in dopaminergic and noradrenergic function are apparently necessary for the clinical efficacy of pharmacological treatment of ADHD [68]. However MPH and ATX have both common and distinct neural effects, consistent with the observation that while many children respond well to both treatments, some respond preferentially to one or the other. Although pharmacotherapy for ADHD appears to prepare and facilitate the brain for learning, experiential programs need to elicit compensatory development in the brain. The clinical amelioration of some children after environmental experiential inputs and early cognitive/behavioural treatment could indicate outcome-associated plastic brain response [69]. One year of treatment with MPH may be beneficial to show enduring normalisation of neural correlates of attention. However, little is known about the long-term effects of stimulants on the functional organisation of the developing brain [70]. Recent findings have shown that chronic MPH use in drug-naive boys with ADHD enhanced neuropsychological functioning on ""recognition memory"" component tasks with modest executive demands [71]. Patients receiving pharmacological treatment for ADHD should always be closely monitored for both common and unusual potentially severe adverse effects.

What are medications used in the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)? In a bulleted format, please also review these medications in further detail such as mechanism of action and risks.","Medications used in the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) include methylphenidate (MPH), atomoxetine (ATX), dextroamphetamine, and guanfacine [63, 64].

*   **Methylphenidate (MPH)**
    *   **Mechanism of action:** MPH treatment causes an increase in dopamine (DA) signalling through multiple actions, including blockade of the DA reuptake transporter, amplification of DA response duration, disinhibition of the dopamine D2 receptor, and amplification of DA tone. It is also an inhibitor of noradrenaline (NE) re-uptake [60]. MPH significantly increases activation in key cortical and subcortical regions subserving attention and executive functions [68].

Patients receiving pharmacological treatment for ADHD should always be closely monitored for both common and unusual potentially severe adverse effects [71].","It's great you're looking into the different treatment options for ADHD! Pharmacological treatments often play a key role, especially when combined with other therapies like psychosocial, behavioural, and educational interventions. These medications primarily work by targeting neurotransmitter systems in the brain, particularly those involving dopamine (DA) and noradrenaline (NE), which are often dysregulated in individuals with ADHD.

It's also important to note that, at least in Italy, pharmacological treatment for ADHD is typically considered after cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has been tried for at least 6 months without sufficient success. Also, patients need to be enrolled in a medication registry before certain treatments can be prescribed.

Here's a breakdown of some of the medications used to treat ADHD, including their mechanisms of action and potential risks, based on the provided document:

*   **Methylphenidate (MPH)**
    *   **Type:** This is a stimulant medication.
    *   **Mechanism of Action:** MPH works by significantly increasing dopamine (DA) signaling in the brain, especially in the fronto-subcortical circuits associated with ADHD. It achieves this through several actions:
        *   It blocks the reuptake transporter for DA, which means more dopamine stays available in the synaptic cleft for longer.
        *   It amplifies the duration of the DA response.
        *   It disinhibits the dopamine D2 receptor.
        *   It amplifies overall DA tone.
        *   MPH also acts as an inhibitor of noradrenaline (NE) re-uptake.
    *   **Risks/Side Effects:** While generally well-tolerated, MPH appears to cause minor increases in both blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR). However, there isn't strong data to suggest it increases the QT interval, a measure of the heart's electrical activity.
    *   **Approval in Italy:** Immediate release MPH is currently approved for ADHD treatment in Italy.

*   **Atomoxetine (ATX)**
    *   **Type:** This is a non-stimulant medication.
    *   **Mechanism of Action:** ATX is a selective inhibitor of synaptic noradrenaline (NE) re-uptake. Interestingly, while it primarily targets NE, it specifically increases extracellular levels of dopamine (DA) in the prefrontal cortex (but not in the striatum). This effect on dopamine is likely achieved by modulating cortical synaptic DA uptake via the NE transporter.
    *   **Risks/Side Effects:** Atomoxetine is generally well-tolerated. Limited data suggest it may cause short-term increases in blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR); however, in the long term, it appears to primarily increase only BP. Its effects on the QT interval remain uncertain.
    *   **Approval in Italy:** Atomoxetine is currently approved for ADHD treatment in Italy.

*   **Dextroamphetamine**
    *   **Type:** This is also a stimulant medication, similar to MPH.
    *   **Mechanism of Action:** Dextroamphetamine increases the synaptic activity of both dopamine (DA) and noradrenaline (NE). It accomplishes this through a multi-pronged approach:
        *   It increases the release of these neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft.
        *   It decreases their reuptake back into the presynaptic neuron.
        *   It inhibits their catabolism (their breakdown by enzymes).
    *   **Risks/Side Effects:** The document notes that stimulant medications like dextroamphetamine are effective. While specific cardiovascular risks for dextroamphetamine aren't detailed in the provided text, the document mentions that concerns surrounding cardiovascular safety have prompted examinations of other similar drugs (like MPH), implying that such monitoring is generally relevant for stimulants. Patients on any pharmacological treatment for ADHD should be monitored for adverse effects.

*   **Guanfacine**
    *   **Type:** This is a non-stimulant medication that functions as a selective alpha2A adrenergic receptor agonist.
    *   **Mechanism of Action:** Guanfacine improves working memory by stimulating postsynaptic alpha2A adrenoceptors. This action strengthens the functional connectivity within prefrontal cortex networks, which are crucial for executive functions.
    *   **Risks/Side Effects:** The document states that Guanfacine has been shown to be effective in reducing ADHD symptoms. While it notes that ADHD pharmacological therapies are generally well-tolerated, specific risks for Guanfacine are not detailed beyond this general statement.

**Important Considerations for all ADHD Medications:**

*   **Holistic Approach:** Drug treatment for ADHD is most effective when it's part of a comprehensive plan that includes psychosocial, behavioural, and educational advice and interventions. Psychotherapy, especially when combined with medication, can be particularly beneficial for managing behavioral problems, organizational issues, and co-occurring psychiatric conditions.
*   **Close Monitoring:** Patients receiving pharmacological treatment for ADHD should always be closely monitored by a healthcare professional for both common and any unusual or potentially severe adverse effects.
*   **Long-term Effects:** While medications can provide significant short-to-medium term benefits, such as normalizing neural correlates of attention, there's still more to learn about the long-term effects of stimulants on the functional organization of the developing brain.
*   **Individualized Treatment:** It's important to remember that while many children respond well to common treatments, some may respond better to one medication over another, highlighting the importance of personalized treatment plans.
*   **Cardiovascular Safety:** The document highlights that the current evidence on cardiovascular effects (especially for ATX and MPH) is based on research not specifically designed for this purpose, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions. This underscores the need for careful clinical monitoring.

Always consult with a healthcare professional to discuss these options and determine the most appropriate treatment plan for ADHD, considering individual needs and circumstances."

A 2021 report from the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) found that private equity
investments in health care substantially expanded in the preceding 20 years, particularly with respect to
acquisitions of health care providers, including hospitals, physician groups, and nursing homes. While the
overall significance of these investments to the health care sector is disputed, they have attracted
regulatory, legislative, and academic interest, particularly in the midst of ongoing conversations about
health care quality and costs.
Scrutiny often focuses on the structure and incentives of private equity investment in health care. Private
equity funds typically aim to acquire portfolio companies, increase their value, and exit from these
investments, generally in a defined time frame. The structure of private equity can involve an array of
corporate entities, which may generally shield fund managers and investors from liability. Regulators
have expressed concern that these institutional features may give private equity firms an “undue focus on
short-term profits and aggressive cost-cutting” that creates unique risks relative to other market
participants, with impacts on patient care and competition. For example, MedPAC’s report details
ongoing debates regarding the effects of private equity efforts to increase profitability in health care
investments by increasing revenue while reducing costs. On the other hand, private equity representatives
and other stakeholders argue that such efforts can improve both efficiency and patient care, and that
private equity has been scapegoated for broader issues in the health care system.
In December 2023, the Biden Administration announced that federal agencies, including the Department
of Justice (DOJ), the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the Federal Trade
Commission (FTC), would take increased actions to lower health care costs, increase quality, and protect
consumers. As part of this effort, the agencies released a Request for Information (RFI) soliciting public
comments on the effects of private equity investments on patients and health care workers. The agencies
argued that “[a]cademic research and agency experience in enforcement actions” have demonstrated that
“patients, health care workers, and others may suffer negative consequences” as a result of these
investments in the health care sector.
Although there is limited federal law that directly addresses private equity ownership in health care,
private equity firms and funds have recently faced claims alongside their portfolio companies in the
health care sector under federal laws concerning both fraudulent and anticompetitive behavior. Legal
commentators have noted the increased legal risk such trends create for private equity investors, whose
involvement in managing portfolio businesses may support alleged knowledge of wrongdoing. This Legal
Sidebar explores recent regulatory and enforcement activities involving private equity investments in
health care under federal antitrust law and the False Claims Act, including efforts to hold private equity
firms and funds directly liable alongside portfolio companies.
The term private equity is often used to refer to a variety of investments that typically pool private funds
from specific, qualified investors for a set period of time and use them to purchase controlling interests in
operating businesses, known as portfolio companies. Private equity funds are generally structured as
limited partnerships; the general partners manage the fund’s investments, and limited partners are those
that invest in the fund but are not directly involved in its operation. A private equity firm may serve as the
general partner for multiple funds, each with their own limited partners and portfolio companies. The
qualified investors who invest as limited partners include pension plans, other private funds, foreign
institutional investors, insurance companies, and high-net-worth individuals. Investments in portfolio
companies could take the form of leveraged buyouts. For more information on the private equity industry
generally, including its structure, size, and common terminology, see CRS Report R47053, Private Equity
and Capital Markets Policy, by Eva Su.
The typical structure of a private equity fund will thus involve several separate entities, all of which are
distinct from the portfolio companies controlled by the fund. Portfolio companies may themselves consist
of a collection of separate legal entities, including corporations and limited liability companies (LLCs).
Under general principles of corporate law, the shareholders of a corporation and the members of an LLC
are ordinarily not liable for the entity’s obligations. Instead, they risk only the amount they have invested
in the business.
These principles do not always shield owners from liability. In some rare circumstances, the corporate
entity may be disregarded and liability imposed upon the company’s owners for corporate conduct, a
process called piercing the corporate veil. Owners of a company may also be held directly liable for their
own conduct, separate from the company’s conduct or liability.

What are the leading arguments around private equity firms trying to increase revenue and reduce costs in healthcare?","Regulators are concerned that the institutional features of private equity may lead to an ""undue focus on short-term profits and aggressive cost-cutting,"" which could create unique risks and impact patient care and competition (MedPAC report, p. 1). MedPAC's report details ongoing debates regarding the effects of private equity efforts to increase profitability by increasing revenue while reducing costs (MedPAC report, p. 1). Conversely, private equity representatives and other stakeholders contend that such efforts can improve both efficiency and patient care, and that private equity is being scapegoated for broader issues within the health care system (MedPAC report, p. 1).","It's a really interesting and often debated topic! When private equity firms invest in healthcare, a major part of their strategy is to increase profitability, which often involves efforts to increase revenue and reduce costs within the healthcare providers they acquire. This approach brings with it a set of strong arguments both for and against its impact.

Here's a breakdown of the leading arguments:

**Arguments Against (Concerns and Criticisms):**

*   **Undue Focus on Short-Term Profits and Aggressive Cost-Cutting:** Regulators, like those cited in the MedPAC report, often express concern that the typical private equity model, which aims to acquire, increase value, and then exit within a defined timeframe, can lead to an intense focus on short-term financial gains. This might encourage aggressive cost-cutting measures that could potentially compromise the quality of patient care.
*   **Risks to Patient Care and Competition:** This pursuit of short-term profits and cost reduction is seen by some as creating ""unique risks"" compared to other market participants. There are worries that it could negatively impact the quality of services provided to patients or even stifle healthy competition within the healthcare market.
*   **Negative Consequences for Patients and Workers:** Federal agencies, including the DOJ, HHS, and FTC, have pointed to academic research and their own enforcement experiences, suggesting that these investments can lead to negative consequences for patients and healthcare workers. This implies that the drive for increased revenue and reduced costs might result in poorer patient outcomes or adverse working conditions.

**Arguments For (Defenses and Potential Benefits):**

*   **Improved Efficiency:** Advocates for private equity in healthcare, including private equity representatives and other stakeholders, argue that their efforts to increase revenue and reduce costs can actually lead to significant improvements in efficiency. By streamlining operations and optimizing resource allocation, they contend that healthcare providers can deliver services more effectively.
*   **Enhanced Patient Care:** Counter-intuitively to some critics, proponents suggest that these efficiency improvements can ultimately translate into better patient care. The idea is that more efficiently run organizations might have more resources available for technology upgrades, staff training, or innovative care models, leading to higher quality services.
*   **""Scapegoating"" for Broader Issues:** Private equity firms and their supporters often argue that they are being unfairly blamed for systemic issues that already exist within the broader healthcare system. They believe that many of the problems attributed to their investments are pre-existing challenges that the healthcare sector faces, regardless of ownership structure.

In essence, the debate boils down to whether the profit-driven incentives of private equity can genuinely align with, or ultimately detract from, the core mission of providing high-quality, affordable healthcare. It's a complex issue that continues to attract significant regulatory, legislative, and academic scrutiny, especially given the ongoing conversations about healthcare quality and costs in general."

Key Points
 Pancreatitis in dogs is potentially life-threatening — know the signs to look for.
 If you suspect your dog may have pancreatitis, a call to the veterinarian quickly is vital.
 There are a number of causes and risk factors that can bring on pancreatitis, though it often seems to hit out of the blue.
 emergency
 Pancreatitis in dogs is one of those conditions that owners must be informed about before it strikes because the warning signs may not always be obvious at first, the symptoms might be mistaken for something less serious, and yet it’s potentially life-threatening. The medical definition of pancreatitis is simple: “inflammation of the pancreas.” But like all serious conditions, there is more to it than that.
 

 Because it is dangerous, a suspected case of pancreatitis needs to be addressed by a veterinarian as quickly as possible and not dealt with by “DIY” treatments. As with all medical issues, even the best online resource is not a replacement for the medical guidance from your vet.
 

 Before looking at the details of pancreatitis, let’s take away the “ititis” and explain the small but vital organ itself:
 

 The pancreas is responsible for releasing enzymes that aid in digestion. When the organ is working normally, the enzymes become active only when they reach the small intestine. In a dog with pancreatitis, however, the enzymes activate when they’re released, inflaming and causing damage to the pancreas and its surrounding tissue and other organs. According to the Whole Dog Journal, the enzymes can actually begin to digest the pancreas itself, which causes extreme pain to your dog.
 

 pancreatitis xray
 Classic signs of pancreatitis in dogs
 Hunched back
 Repeated vomiting (either several times within a few hours or periodically over several days)
 Pain or distention of the abdomen (dog appears uncomfortable or bloated)
 Diarrhea
 Loss of appetite
 Dehydration
 Weakness/lethargy
 Fever
 If your dog exhibits one of these signs, and only infrequently, monitor her. But if she exhibits multiple signs at once, and repeatedly, a call to the veterinarian quickly is vital.
 

 Dehydration and pancreatitis in dogs
 Dehydration is due to a greater fluid loss than fluid intake. Diarrhea or vomiting can cause dehydration, but those signs together will cause a greater fluid deficit and dehydration because the dog’s fluid input (drinking) cannot keep up with the fluid losses. If the diarrhea becomes bloody, the condition worsens and the dehydration can become an emergency.
 

 Other factors such as fever require increase fluid intake and can lead to dehydration along with other metabolic issues such as kidney disease, etc.
 

 Blood in a dog’s stool indicates a loos and significant inflammatory response requiring a veterinarian’s attention but it can be cause by a multitude of factors, from ulceration to parasites. Dehydration is a serious condition that can lead to death. It is an emergency and requires immediate veterinary care.
 

 Any lethargic dog who is not drinking water or cannot hold water down should be suspect of dehydration and examined by a veterinarian. Dry mucous membranes (such as gums) may be a quick way of assessing dehydration but as always, when in doubt, consult with your veterinarian.

 Causes of pancreatitis in dogs
 There are a number of causes and risk factors that can bring on pancreatitis. Though often the attack appears seemingly out of the blue. Among them are:
 

 A high-fat diet
 This is a major cause of pancreatitis, especially for a dog who gets one large helping of fatty food in one sitting
 A history of dietary indiscretion (a medical term for saying your dog will eat anything)
 Obesity
 Hypothyroidism (or other endocrine diseases)
 Severe blunt trauma
 Diabetes mellitus
 Certain medications or other toxins
 These include cholinesterase inhibitors, calcium, potassium bromide, phenobarbital, l-asparaginase, estrogen, salicylates, azathioprine, thiazide diuretics, and vinca alkaloids.
 There may, in some cases, be a genetic predisposition. Certain breeds or types of dogs have been associated with higher risks of pancreatitis such as Miniature Schnauzers and some of the smaller toy and terrier breeds.
 More about those fats: Human food is especially dangerous, though even high-fat dog food may cause pancreatitis. So owner vigilance is particularly required around holidays and other festive occasions—they can bring well-meaning guests who slip your buddy a fatty piece of lamb, or a tray of buttery cookies left within reach of an eager muzzle. In fact, the day after Thanksgiving is known for more than just Black Friday bargains. It’s one of the busiest days of the year pancreatitis-related emergency vet visits.
 

 Basically, if your dog is showing any signs of abdominal pain, the worst thing to do is feed him a fatty diet. This is one of many reasons that giving your dog table scraps, as tempting as it may be, is not advisable.
 

 How does a vet diagnose pancreatitis in dogs?
 Your dog’s medical history
 Blood tests to measure pancreatic enzymes
 Physical examination including stomach, gums, heart, temperature
 Radiographs or ultrasound, to rule out other causes
 Fine needle aspiration of the pancreas
 As the Merck Veterinary Manual notes, as with any disease, no test should be used in isolation for diagnosis, and all clinical findings should be used in conjunction to arrive at the most appropriate diagnosis.
 

 

 What’s the difference between acute and chronic pancreatitis?
 Acute Pancreatitis
 An acute attack of pancreatitis means it comes on suddenly, with no previous appearance of the condition before. It can become life threatening to other organs if the inflammation spreads.
 

 Chronic Pancreatitis
 A chronic condition is one that has developed over time, slowly, and often without symptoms. This condition can result from repeated bouts of acute pancreatitis.
 

 Both acute and chronic forms can be either severe or mild, and both result in pain.
 

 Treatment and management of pancreatitis in dogs
 There’s no fancy treatment for acute pancreatitis. First and foremost, your dog’s pain must be managed, and early intervention to prevent further complications is key. The most common treatment and management options are:
 

 Intravenous (IV) fluid therapy in severe pancreatitis
 Vigorous monitoring of a worsening condition
 Antiemetic medication for vomiting (to prevent dehydration)
 Resting the pancreas (withholding food and water for 24 hours)
 Long-term management includes:
 Vigilant monitoring of fat intake—No table scraps allowed!
 Use of a prescription diet of gastrointestinal-supportive low-fat, or ultra-low fat, food.
 Feed smaller, more frequent meals instead of one larger meal
 Have amylase and lipase levels checked by a veterinarian regularly
 Can supplements be used to prevent or manage pancreatitis in dogs?
 It is important to reiterate that pancreatitis is a serious condition, so home remedies shouldn’t be used in place of veterinary intervention. That said, some vets believe digestive enzyme supplements with pancreatin can help some (not all) dogs by reducing the work of the pancreas and inhibiting pancreatic secretion. These come in over-the-counter strength as well as prescription strength.
 

 Fish oil may seem counterintuitive at first, because of its high fat content, but it can actually help lower blood lipid levels. Studies suggest a high level of fish oil (about 1,000 mg. per 10 pounds of body weight for dog with high lipid levels; about half that amount for dogs with normal levels) is helpful to dogs with acute pancreatitis. When supplementing with fish oil, also supplement with 5 to 10 IU of vitamin E.
 

 There have been human studies suggesting that vitamin E (with selenium), vitamin C, beta-carotene, and methionine may help prevent pancreatitis. Conversely, another human study reveals that probiotics can make acute pancreatitis worse.
 

 Always speak with your veterinarian before offering any supplements to your pet.

My vet told me he thinks my dog has pancreatitis. I'm worried I have done something to cause it. What are the signs and symptoms of this? Are certain breeds prone to this and what are some risk factors? He wants me to bring him in for testing. What will they do to him?","The provided document contains the following information regarding your questions:

**Signs and Symptoms of Pancreatitis in Dogs:**
Classic signs of pancreatitis in dogs include hunched back, repeated vomiting (either several times within a few hours or periodically over several days), pain or distention of the abdomen (dog appears uncomfortable or bloated), diarrhea, loss of appetite, dehydration, weakness/lethargy, and fever (Classic signs of pancreatitis in dogs). If your dog exhibits multiple signs at once, and repeatedly, a call to the veterinarian quickly is vital (Classic signs of pancreatitis in dogs).

**Breeds Prone to Pancreatitis:**
There may, in some cases, be a genetic predisposition. Certain breeds or types of dogs have been associated with higher risks of pancreatitis such as Miniature Schnauzers and some of the smaller toy and terrier breeds (Causes of pancreatitis in dogs).

**Risk Factors for Pancreatitis:**
There are a number of causes and risk factors that can bring on pancreatitis, though often the attack appears seemingly out of the blue (Causes of pancreatitis in dogs). These include:
*   A high-fat diet, especially a large helping of fatty food in one sitting (Causes of pancreatitis in dogs).
*   A history of dietary indiscretion (dog will eat anything) (Causes of pancreatitis in dogs).
*   Obesity (Causes of pancreatitis in dogs).
*   Hypothyroidism (or other endocrine diseases) (Causes of pancreatitis in dogs).
*   Severe blunt trauma (Causes of pancreatitis in dogs).
*   Diabetes mellitus (Causes of pancreatitis in dogs).
*   Certain medications or other toxins, including cholinesterase inhibitors, calcium, potassium bromide, phenobarbital, l-asparaginase, estrogen, salicylates, azathioprine, thiazide diuretics, and vinca alkaloids (Causes of pancreatitis in dogs).
*   Genetic predisposition in certain breeds such as Miniature Schnauzers and some of the smaller toy and terrier breeds (Causes of pancreatitis in dogs).

**What a Vet Will Do for Testing:**
To diagnose pancreatitis in dogs, a veterinarian may perform the following:
*   Review your dog’s medical history (How does a vet diagnose pancreatitis in dogs?).
*   Blood tests to measure pancreatic enzymes (How does a vet diagnose pancreatitis in dogs?).
*   A physical examination including the stomach, gums, heart, and temperature (How does a vet diagnose pancreatitis in dogs?).
*   Radiographs or ultrasound, to rule out other causes (How does a vet diagnose pancreatitis in dogs?).
*   Fine needle aspiration of the pancreas (How does a vet diagnose pancreatitis in dogs?).
As with any disease, no test should be used in isolation for diagnosis, and all clinical findings should be used in conjunction to arrive at the most appropriate diagnosis (How does a vet diagnose pancreatitis in dogs?).","Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear you're worried about your dog possibly having pancreatitis. It's completely normal to feel concerned and even wonder if you've done something to cause it – many pet parents feel that way. Please try not to blame yourself; as the document mentions, it often seems to hit ""out of the blue,"" and there are many factors at play. The most important thing is that you're getting your dog to the vet for proper care.

Let's break down your questions so you have a better understanding of what's going on:

### Signs and Symptoms of Pancreatitis in Dogs

Pancreatitis can be quite painful and serious, so knowing these signs is crucial. If your dog exhibits multiple signs repeatedly, a quick call to the vet is vital.

Here are the classic signs to look for:

*   **Hunched back:** This posture often indicates abdominal pain.
*   **Repeated vomiting:** This could be several times within a few hours or periodically over several days.
*   **Pain or distention of the abdomen:** Your dog might appear uncomfortable or bloated, and resist being touched around the belly.
*   **Diarrhea:** This can range from mild to severe, and if it becomes bloody, it's a serious emergency.
*   **Loss of appetite:** Dogs in pain or feeling nauseous often refuse to eat.
*   **Dehydration:** This can result from vomiting and diarrhea, and is a life-threatening emergency. Signs include dry gums and lethargy.
*   **Weakness/lethargy:** Your dog might seem unusually tired, listless, or unwilling to move.
*   **Fever:** An elevated body temperature can be a sign of inflammation or infection.

If you see just one of these signs infrequently, you might monitor your dog, but if you notice multiple signs at once and they are recurring, it's definitely time to get to the vet right away.

### Are Certain Breeds Prone to Pancreatitis and What Are the Risk Factors?

Yes, there can be a genetic component, and certain breeds and factors can increase a dog's risk, though sometimes it truly just happens unexpectedly.

**Breeds that may be more prone:**
Miniature Schnauzers are specifically mentioned as having a higher risk, as well as some of the smaller toy and terrier breeds.

**Risk Factors and Causes:**
Here's where your concern about causing it might come in, but please remember these are just *risk factors* and don't guarantee your dog will get it. Also, many dogs with these risk factors never develop pancreatitis, and many without them do!

*   **A high-fat diet:** This is a major cause, especially if a dog consumes a large amount of fatty food in one sitting. This is why holidays (like the day after Thanksgiving, which is known for a spike in pancreatitis-related vet visits) are particularly risky times due to well-meaning guests or accessible forbidden treats.
*   **History of dietary indiscretion:** This is a fancy medical term for a dog who will eat just about anything they shouldn't!
*   **Obesity:** Being overweight can increase the risk.
*   **Hypothyroidism (or other endocrine diseases):** These underlying conditions can make a dog more susceptible.
*   **Diabetes mellitus:** Another endocrine disease linked to pancreatitis.
*   **Severe blunt trauma:** Physical injury can sometimes trigger it.
*   **Certain medications or other toxins:** A number of drugs can be implicated, including cholinesterase inhibitors, calcium, potassium bromide, phenobarbital, and others listed in the document.
*   **Genetic predisposition:** As mentioned with certain breeds.

It's really important to avoid giving your dog table scraps, especially fatty ones, as this is a common trigger.

### What Will the Vet Do for Testing?

When you bring your dog in, your vet will perform a thorough examination and likely recommend specific tests to confirm a diagnosis of pancreatitis and rule out other conditions. They will use a combination of these methods:

1.  **Medical History:** They'll ask you a lot of questions about your dog's recent behavior, diet, any symptoms you've observed, and previous health issues.
2.  **Physical Examination:** This will be comprehensive, including checking your dog's abdomen for pain or distention, assessing their hydration levels (e.g., checking gums), listening to their heart and lungs, and taking their temperature.
3.  **Blood Tests:** These are crucial. They'll measure specific pancreatic enzymes (like amylase and lipase) which can be elevated during an attack.
4.  **Radiographs (X-rays) or Ultrasound:** These imaging techniques help to visualize the pancreas and surrounding organs. An ultrasound, in particular, can often show changes to the pancreas, and both can help rule out other causes of abdominal pain, like foreign objects or tumors.
5.  **Fine Needle Aspiration of the Pancreas:** In some cases, if the diagnosis is still unclear, a vet might collect a small sample of pancreatic tissue for analysis, although this is less common for an initial diagnosis.

Your vet will use all these findings together – not just one test in isolation – to arrive at the most accurate diagnosis for your dog.

It's excellent that you're taking your dog in for testing quickly. Early diagnosis and intervention are key for managing pancreatitis and preventing complications. I hope your dog feels better soon!"

The emergence of foundation models, especially Large Language Models (LLMs), has revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence. These models, exemplified by their extensive training data and capacity for generalization, have dramatically expanded the horizons of computational linguistics, text understanding, and text generation [5, 10, 34–37]. However, a critical challenge faced by LLMs is their limited efficacy in executing complex reasoning tasks, particularly in areas requiring deep, abstract thought such as advanced mathematics [25]. This limitation points towards a need for enhanced methodologies that can augment LLMs’ reasoning faculties.
The root of this challenge lies in the architecture of modern LLMs, which is predominantly oriented toward auto-regressive token prediction [5, 35, 36]. While efficient for a broad spectrum of tasks, this approach is

 
not meticulously designed to support the depth and sophistication of human-like analytical thinking. This discrepancy is highlighted by the dual-process theory of cognitive psychology, articulated by Kahneman [21], which differentiates the fast, intuitive responses of System 1 thinking from the slower, more deliberate reasoning of System 2 thinking. LLMs, in their typical operations, mirror System 1 processes and thus encounter difficulties with tasks that require the more deliberate, structured approach characteristic of System 2 thinking.
Attempts to bridge this gap have led to the development of innovative methodologies such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) [44] and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) [28, 49], which guide LLMs in articulating intermediate steps in reasoning tasks. These methods, although valuable, have not fully realized the depth and flexibility of human cognitive processes in an abstract sense.
In response to these challenges, we introduce Meta Prompting (MP) and establish a theoretical framework for it, a novel approach that represents a substantial advance in the field of LLM reasoning. Meta Prompting extends beyond existing methods by abstracting and generalizing key principles for enhanced cognitive processing. Unlike its predecessors, Meta Prompting shifts the focus from content-driven reasoning to a more structure-oriented perspective. This method draws inspiration from category theory and type theory, establishing a functorial relationship between tasks and their corresponding prompts. This categorical approach allows for a more systematic and adaptable framework, capable of addressing a wide range of cognitive tasks with depth and nuance akin to human reasoning.
Furthermore, a pivotal aspect of meta prompting is its application to Meta Prompting for prompting tasks in an in-context and recursive way utilizing the functorial and compositional properties of Meta Prompting, which we call Recursive Meta Prompting (RMP). This concept, akin to metaprogramming in programming language theory, involves using LLMs to design new prompts autonomously. The functorial nature of Meta Prompting allows for this advanced capability, where LLMs can not only solve problems but also generate the structures to solve them. This self-referential and recursive ability marks a significant leap in LLMs’ autonomy and adaptability.
The practical efficacy of the Meta Prompting framework is empirically validated through a series of experiments, ranging from solving the Game of 24 puzzles [49] to addressing complex MATH problems [17], underscoring the Meta Prompting’s versatility and empowering LLMs with advanced reasoning capabilities.
In summary, our contributions can be listed as follows:
• We propose the structured and syntax-oriented Meta Prompting (MP), and introduce a theoretical framework for meta prompting based on category theory. We further investigate meta prompting for prompting tasks and Recursive Meta Prompting (RMP) in a metaprogramming-like manner.
• Our experiments on solving MATH problems with a Qwen-72B base language model [3] equipped with meta prompt without instruction-tuning to solve MATH problems with accuracy at 46.3% which surpasses the supervised fine-tuned counterpart trained with extensive mathematical QA instruction pairs and even the initial version of GPT-4, solving GSM8K problems with 83.5% accuracy with zero-shot meta-prompted Qwen-72B base language model, and solving the Game of 24 tasks with 100% success rate using GPT-4, show the efficacy of meta prompting in problem-solving and in-context alignment.

I. Introduction  
Fast fashion is an approach to the design, creation, and marketing of clothing with an emphasis on making trends quickly and cheaply available to consumers.2  The term was coined by the New York Times in the early 2000s when describing Zara’s mission to take a garment from the design stage to being sold in stores in just fifteen days.3  The idea behind this phenomenon is to get the newest styles on the market as fast as possible so that consumers can get them at the height of their popularity.4  Increased consumption in wealthy, first-world countries has driven the success of fast fashion and placed a significant strain on garment factories and their workers.5  Because fashion is one of the most labor-dependent industries—as each piece of apparel must be handmade along a lengthy supply chain—brands have looked to outsource labor overseas to minimize costs and maximize profits.6  The goal of outsourcing is to locate low-cost production sources in emerging economies, like Bangladesh, where input costs are low and productivity is high.7  As retail prices have decreased and production prices have increased, there continues to be pressure on manufacturers’ margins.8  Because of this cycle, garment workers are often subjected to poor employment conditions and factories are less able to invest in the improvement of labor conditions or increase workers’ pay.9  
For decades, brands have turned a blind eye to these key issues, continuing to profit off cheap, forced labor.10  Zara, H&M, and Topshop were among the first companies to take looks and designs from top fashion houses and reproduce them quickly and cheaply.11  Key characteristics of fast fashion brands include: (1) having thousands of styles, particularly those that touch on the latest trends; (2) extremely short turnaround times between when a trend is seen on the catwalk and when it hits the shelves; (3) offshore manufacturing where labor is cheap; (4) limited quantities of particular garments; and (5) cheap, low-quality materials.12  This note will explore how the fast fashion cycle perpetuates neglect of consumer responsibility, social and ecological harm, capitalization of fast production and cheap prices, and labor exploitation. 
II. Background 
A. A Journey Down the Supply Chain As clothes have gotten cheaper, trend cycles have sped up, and shopping has become a hobby, consumers, perhaps unknowingly, have perpetuated a cycle of abusive labor practices in overseas garment factories.13  Because labor costs remain high in the Western Hemisphere, production has largely moved overseas and fashion companies industry-wide are utilizing subcontracting to produce their garments.14  Subcontracting is the process by which a company divides parts of the supply chain across multiple countries and into multiple parts, including design, spinning, yarn production, dyeing, cutting, stitching, and final garment production.15  The general supply chain involves multiple steps: (1) cotton is grown and sold to the global market; (2) spinners use cotton or synthetic fibers to produce yarn or fabric; (3) garment factories cut and sew the fabric and add trim to produce garments; (4) garment factories that lack capacity for some processes subcontract them to other facilities; (5) garments are shipped to the brands that place the order; (6) brands distribute the garments to retail and online stores; and (7) consumers purchase the garments.16  Subcontracting allows for the success of fast fashion because it permits companies to utilize the low cost of overseas labor as subcontracted units are not regulated.17  It is not uncommon that the clothing consumers buy in store has already been in multiple different countries or factories before hitting the shelves.18  
Manufacturing supply chains in the fashion industry are known for being rife with abuse, forced labor, and extremely low wages.19  Buyers often participate in a practice called “underground bidding,” where they use the quoted prices of one factory to get another factory to lower their prices.20  The company then selects the factory that commits to the fastest turnaround time and the lowest price, effectively pushing down wages and worsening working conditions.21  This perpetuates a skewed power dynamic where buyers dominate, as factories accept low prices for orders while remaining under pressure to maintain high product quality and productivity levels with very little financial resources.22  As delivery time for orders has decreased ten to twenty percent over the last five years, urgent orders have become more frequent.23  Consequently, workers are forced to work overtime hours, often without overtime pay, in order to meet these quick turnaround times and order changes.24 
B. Working Conditions in Overseas Garment Factories 
Workers in fashion supply chains often endure unimaginable conditions in garment factories, where buildings lack fire alarms, and managers can lock doors and keep workers in until they complete the orders.25  Other dangerous conditions include crumbling buildings, broken alarms, and missing sprinklers and fire barriers.26  In countries like Bangladesh, local laws regulating fire safety, pay, and working conditions are not well-enforced as there are not enough inspectors and there is significant potential for the corruption of officials.27  Specifically, the Bangladesh government has failed to enforce national building codes, especially in buildings owned by wellconnected landlords.28  Thus, garment workers often endure brutal, unsafe working conditions at the mercy of their employer.29 
In 2013, an eight-story clothing manufacturing building in Dhaka, Bangladesh collapsed, killing over one thousand garment workers.30  Just five months earlier, at least 112 workers died in a factory fire in Tazreen on the outskirts of Dhaka.31  Following these incidents, many major United States (U.S.) retailers joined safety-monitoring groups that required them to stop selling clothing from factories that violated safety standards.32  But Amazon—one of the world’s largest retailers— did not join this coalition and continues to sell clothing made from factories operating under similar conditions.33  Amazon has stated that it does not inspect the factories that produce the clothing they buy from wholesalers or other third-party sellers.34  In fact, the company will only remove a product from their site if they become aware that the product came from a factory that may not meet their supply chain standards.35  With a marketplace as large as Amazon’s, this is clearly a problem as it keeps unsafe workplaces up and running.36  While consumers may not currently be aware that the clothing they are buying originated in a factory where workers are subject to long hours and serious injuries, it is important that it is made known and steps are taken to end such practices.  
III. Development and Problems 
A. Absence of Worker Protections in the Garment Industries Stark contrasts exist between garment workers’ rights in countries like the U.S. and Bangladesh.37  While workers in the U.S. have protection under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and through regulatory oversight, Bangladesh lacks a well-functioning labor inspection system or enforcement mechanisms.38  Moreover, because supply chains are organizationally fragmented and geographically dispersed, it becomes difficult for garment workers to unionize and fight for change.39 
1. Minimum Wage A living wage is the lowest wage paid to a full-time worker—earned in no more than forty-eight hours per week—needed to cover basics like food, decent housing, healthcare, clothing, transportation, utilities, childcare, education, and other essential needs, in addition to some savings for the future and unexpected events.40  The legal minimum wage for garment workers in Bangladesh is approximately 8000 taka per month, which amounts to $79 USD.41  But instead of paying workers a legal minimum wage, some factories will utilize a piece-rate system in which they pay workers pennies per garment sewn—a practice also used in the U.S.42  Under this system, workers are paid $0.02 to $0.06 per garment, which can translate to, at most, $6 per hour.43 
Although the Bangladesh government sets a minimum wage, it is not properly enforced, resulting in many workers making much less.44  In a research study examining the working conditions and lives of garment workers in Bangladesh and Vietnam, one hundred percent of garment workers interviewed in Bangladesh earned below a living wage.45  Of those interviewed, ninety percent said they could not afford enough food for themselves or their families, seventy-two percent could not afford medical treatment when they got sick or injured, seventy-six percent had no running water inside their home, and thirty-three percent had been separated from their children, primarily due to insufficient income.46  Moreover, Fifty-six percent of workers reported that they experienced wage cuts, although technically illegal in Bangladesh, for things such as not meeting targets, absence, late attendance, poor quality, product mistakes, or refusing to do overtime or night duty.  In order to make ends meet, parents often remove their children from school to start working in garment factories—some as young as eleven years old.

Discuss the concept of fast fashion and its effect on workers as outlined in the text.","Fast fashion is an approach to the design, creation, and marketing of clothing that focuses on making trends quickly and cheaply available to consumers (2). Coined by the New York Times in the early 2000s, it aims to get the newest styles on the market as fast as possible for consumers to purchase at the height of their popularity (3, 4). Key characteristics of fast fashion brands include offering thousands of styles that reflect the latest trends, extremely short turnaround times from catwalk to shelves, offshore manufacturing where labor is cheap, limited quantities of specific garments, and the use of cheap, low-quality materials (12). This phenomenon is driven by increased consumption in wealthy, first-world countries (5).

The pursuit of fast fashion has placed a significant strain on garment factories and their workers, leading to labor exploitation (5, 12). Brands outsource labor overseas to minimize costs and maximize profits, seeking low-cost production in emerging economies like Bangladesh (6, 7). This creates pressure on manufacturers' margins due to decreased retail prices and increased production costs, resulting in garment workers being subjected to poor employment conditions and factories being less able to invest in improving labor conditions or increasing pay (8, 9). For decades, brands have profited from what the document describes as ""cheap, forced labor"" (10).

Specifically, the effects on workers include:
*   **Abusive Labor Practices** Consumers, perhaps unknowingly, perpetuate a cycle of abusive labor practices in overseas garment factories (13). Manufacturing supply chains in the fashion industry are known for abuse, forced labor, and extremely low wages (19).
*   **Low Wages and Lack of a Living Wage** The legal minimum wage for garment workers in Bangladesh is approximately $79 USD per month, but it is not properly enforced, leading many workers to earn much less (41, 44). Some factories use a piece-rate system, paying workers as little as $0.02 to $0.06 per garment, which can translate to a maximum of $6 per hour (42, 43). A study found that 100% of garment workers interviewed in Bangladesh earned below a living wage (45). Consequently, many workers cannot afford enough food (90%), medical treatment (72%), or running water (76%), and 33% have been separated from their children due to insufficient income (46).
*   **Wage Cuts** Fifty-six percent of workers reported experiencing illegal wage cuts for reasons such as not meeting targets, absence, late attendance, poor quality, product mistakes, or refusing overtime (47).
*   **Forced Overtime** As delivery times for orders have decreased, urgent orders have become more frequent, forcing workers to work overtime hours, often without overtime pay, to meet quick turnaround times (23, 24).
*   **Unsafe Working Conditions** Workers often endure ""unimaginable"" and ""brutal, unsafe"" conditions in factories (25, 29). Buildings may lack fire alarms, and managers can lock doors to keep workers inside until orders are completed (25). Other dangerous conditions include crumbling buildings, broken alarms, and missing sprinklers and fire barriers (26). In countries like Bangladesh, local laws regulating fire safety, pay, and working conditions are poorly enforced, and the government has failed to enforce national building codes (27, 28). Tragic incidents like the 2013 Rana Plaza collapse, which killed over a thousand garment workers, and a factory fire five months earlier that killed at least 112 workers, highlight these dangers (30, 31).
*   **Lack of Worker Protections** There is a stark contrast between worker rights in countries like the U.S. and Bangladesh; Bangladesh lacks a well-functioning labor inspection system or enforcement mechanisms (37, 38). The fragmented and dispersed nature of supply chains makes it difficult for garment workers to unionize and advocate for change (39).
*   **Child Labor** To make ends meet, parents sometimes remove their children from school to work in garment factories, with some as young as eleven years old (48).","Fast fashion is a business model focused on rapidly producing trendy, inexpensive clothing to make styles quickly and cheaply available to consumers. The term itself emerged in the early 2000s, coined by the New York Times to describe Zara's ability to bring a garment from design to store shelves in a mere fifteen days. Driven by increased consumption in wealthier nations, fast fashion aims to get the newest styles to market at the height of their popularity.

This pursuit of speed and low cost, however, places an immense strain on garment factories and their workers, particularly in emerging economies like Bangladesh, where labor costs are minimized. Because clothing production is highly labor-dependent, brands outsource manufacturing overseas to maximize profits. The pressure of decreasing retail prices coupled with increasing production costs squeezes manufacturers' margins, leading to a cycle where factories are unable to invest in improving labor conditions or increasing workers' pay. For decades, many brands have knowingly profited from these issues, effectively relying on cheap, often forced, labor.

The fast fashion cycle has a profound and devastating impact on workers:

1.  **Abusive Labor Practices and Exploitation:** Consumers, often unknowingly, perpetuate a system rife with abuse, forced labor, and extremely low wages in overseas garment factories. The industry-wide reliance on subcontracting, which allows companies to leverage unregulated, low-cost labor units, fragments the supply chain, making oversight difficult.
2.  **""Underground Bidding"" and Wage Suppression:** Buyers frequently engage in ""underground bidding,"" using competing factories' quotes to drive down prices. This often results in factories accepting very low prices for orders while still being pressured to maintain high product quality and productivity with minimal financial resources. This dynamic directly pushes down wages and worsens working conditions.
3.  **Forced Overtime and Unpaid Work:** As delivery times for orders have significantly decreased, urgent orders have become more frequent. Workers are routinely forced to work extensive overtime hours, often without appropriate overtime pay, simply to meet tight deadlines and last-minute order changes.
4.  **Deplorable and Unsafe Working Conditions:** Garment factory workers frequently endure unimaginable conditions. Buildings may lack essential safety features like fire alarms, sprinklers, and fire barriers, with managers sometimes locking doors to keep workers inside until orders are completed. In countries like Bangladesh, local laws regarding safety, pay, and working conditions are poorly enforced due to a lack of inspectors and potential for corruption. This has led to tragic incidents, such as the 2013 Rana Plaza building collapse in Dhaka, Bangladesh, which killed over a thousand garment workers, and a 2012 factory fire in Tazreen that killed 112.
5.  **Sub-Living Wages and Economic Hardship:** Despite a legal minimum wage in Bangladesh (approximately $79 USD per month), many factories pay workers significantly less, often through a piece-rate system where they earn mere pennies per garment. Research indicates that 100% of garment workers interviewed in Bangladesh earned below a living wage. This extreme poverty means workers cannot afford basic necessities; a significant percentage cannot afford food, medical treatment, or even running water. Many are separated from their children due to insufficient income, and parents are sometimes forced to pull children as young as eleven out of school to work in factories.
6.  **Lack of Worker Protections and Unionization Challenges:** Unlike workers in countries with robust labor laws like the U.S. (e.g., Fair Labor Standards Act), garment workers in countries like Bangladesh lack a well-functioning labor inspection system and enforcement mechanisms. The fragmented and geographically dispersed nature of supply chains also makes it incredibly difficult for workers to unionize and collectively advocate for better conditions or pay.
7.  **Illegal Wage Cuts:** Many workers report experiencing illegal wage cuts for reasons such as not meeting targets, absence, late attendance, poor quality, product mistakes, or refusing overtime or night duties.

In essence, fast fashion's drive for rapid trends and low prices comes at an enormous human cost, perpetuating a cycle of labor exploitation, unsafe workplaces, and pervasive poverty for the millions of workers who produce our clothes."

Higher APR margin has fueled the profitability of revolving balances.
 Typically, card issuers set an APR margin to generate a profit that is at least commensurate with the risk of lending money to consumers. In the eight years after the Great Recession, the average APR margin stayed around 10 percent, as issuers adapted to reforms in the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (CARD Act) that restricted harmful back-end and hidden pricing practices. But issuers began to gradually increase APR margin in 2016. The trend accelerated in 2018, and it continued through the pandemic.
 

 Over the past decade, card issuers increased APR margin despite lower charge-off rates and a relatively stable share of cardholders with subprime credit scores. The average APR margin increased 4.3 percentage points from 2013 to 2023 (while the prime rate was nearly 5 percentage points higher). As such, the profitability of revolving balances excluding loan loss provisions (the money that banks set aside for expected charge-offs) has been increasing over this time period.
 

 Figure 2: Average APR Margin and Charge-Off Rate (Federal Reserve)
 Figure 2 is a line graph that shows the quarterly average APR margin and charge off rate from 1995 through 2023. Since 2013, the APR margin has generally increased while the charge off rate decreased.
 Source: Federal Reserve
 Excess APR margin costs consumers billions of dollars a year.
 In 2023, major credit card issuers, with around $590 billion in revolving balances, charged an estimated $25 billion in additional interest fees by raising the average APR margin by 4.3 percentage points over the last ten years. For an average consumer with a $5,300 balance across credit cards, the excess APR margin cost them over $250 in 2023. Since finance charges are typically part of the minimum amount due, this additional interest burden may push consumers into persistent debt, accruing more in interest and fees than they pay towards the principal each year — or even delinquency.
 

 The increase in APR margin has occurred across all credit tiers. Even consumers with the highest credit scores are incurring higher costs. The average APR margin for accounts with credit scores at 800 or above grew 1.6 percentage points from 2015 to 2022 without a corresponding increase in late payments.
 

 Credit card interest rates are a core driver of profits.
 Credit card issuers are reliant on revenue from interest charged to borrowers who revolve on their balances to drive overall profits, as reflected in increasing APR margins. The return on assets on general purpose cards, one measure of profitability, was higher in 2022 (at 5.9 percent) than in 2019 (at 4.5 percent), and far greater than the returns banks received on other lines of business. Even when excluding the impact of loan loss provisions, the profitability of credit cards has been increasing.
 

 CFPB research has found high levels of concentration in the consumer credit card market and evidence of practices that inhibit consumers’ ability to find alternatives to expensive credit card products. These practices may help explain why credit card issuers have been able to prop up high interest rates to fuel profits. Our recent research has shown that while the top credit card companies dominate the market, smaller issuers many times offer credit cards with significantly lower APRs. The CFPB will continue to take steps to ensure that the consumer credit card market is fair, competitive, and transparent and to help consumers avoid debt spirals that can be difficult to escape.

However, card issuers began to gradually increase the APR margin in 2016, a trend that accelerated in 2018 and continued through the pandemic (Document). Over the past decade, card issuers increased the APR margin, with the average APR margin rising 4.3 percentage points from 2013 to 2023 (Document). This increase in APR margin has occurred across all credit tiers (Document). For accounts with credit scores at 800 or above, the average APR margin grew 1.6 percentage points from 2015 to 2022 (Document).","It sounds like you're experiencing exactly what the document describes, and it's certainly frustrating when your payments barely touch the principal because so much goes to interest. You're not alone in noticing this trend!

Here's how credit card interest rates have changed according to the document:

*   **A Significant Increase:** Credit card issuers have been gradually increasing the Average Percentage Rate (APR) margin since 2016, a trend that accelerated in 2018 and continued through the pandemic.
*   **Decade-Long Rise:** Over the past decade (from 2013 to 2023), the average APR margin has increased by a notable **4.3 percentage points**. This is a substantial jump, especially when you consider that the prime rate also went up by nearly 5 percentage points during the same period.
*   **Not Just for ""Risky"" Borrowers:** What's particularly striking is that this increase in APR margin occurred despite lower charge-off rates (meaning fewer people defaulting on their debts) and a relatively stable share of subprime cardholders. In fact, even consumers with the highest credit scores (800 or above) saw their average APR margin grow by 1.6 percentage points from 2015 to 2022, without a corresponding increase in their late payments.
*   **Higher Profits for Issuers:** This increase in interest rates has directly fueled the profitability of credit card companies. The return on assets for general purpose cards was significantly higher in 2022 (5.9%) compared to 2019 (4.5%), showing how much these higher rates contribute to their bottom line.

**What This Means for Consumers Like You:**

As you've experienced, these higher APRs cost consumers billions of dollars a year. In 2023 alone, the estimated additional interest fees due to this 4.3 percentage point increase over the last ten years amounted to around **$25 billion**. For an average consumer with a $5,300 balance, this meant over $250 in additional costs in 2023.

This ""excess APR margin"" makes it incredibly difficult to pay down balances, pushing people into persistent debt where most of their minimum payment goes towards interest and fees rather than the principal. This can even lead to delinquency.

The document suggests that factors like market concentration and practices that make it hard for consumers to find better alternatives might explain why issuers have been able to continually raise interest rates to boost profits. The good news is that organizations like the CFPB are aware of these issues and are working to ensure a fairer, more competitive, and transparent credit card market to help consumers avoid debt spirals.

It's clear your experience is a direct reflection of these broader market trends, making it harder than ever to manage credit card debt when interest rates are so high."

 FDA-Approved Indications
 

 Amoxicillin is indicated for treating infections caused by susceptible isolates of selected bacteria, specifically beta-lactamase–negative, in the conditions listed below.
 

 Ear, nose, and throat infections: Amoxicillin is approved for the treatment of tonsillitis, pharyngitis, and otitis media in adults and pediatric patients aged 12 and older. The microbiological spectrum covers infections caused by beta-lactamase–negative Streptococcus species (alpha- and beta-hemolytic isolates only), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus species, or H influenzae.[1]
 Helicobacter pylori eradication: H pylori eradication involves triple therapy using clarithromycin, amoxicillin, and lansoprazole to reduce the risk of duodenal ulcer recurrence. In addition, dual treatment with amoxicillin and lansoprazole is FDA-approved for eradicating H pylori infection.[2]
 Lower respiratory tract infections: Amoxicillin is prescribed for treating lower respiratory tract infections caused by beta-lactamase–negative Streptococcus species (limited to alpha- and beta-hemolytic strains), Pneumococcus or Staphylococcus species, or H influenzae. In cases of community-acquired pneumonia, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommends a combination therapy comprising amoxicillin and a macrolide antibiotic.[3]
 Acute bacterial sinusitis: The treatment for acute bacterial sinusitis involves addressing infections caused by beta-lactamase–negative Streptococcus species (limited to alpha- and beta-hemolytic isolates), S pneumoniae, Staphylococcus species, or H influenzae.[4]
 Skin and skin structure infections: Amoxicillin in the immediate-release formulation is prescribed to treat skin infections caused by beta-lactamase–negative Streptococcus species (restricted to alpha- and beta-hemolytic strains), Staphylococcus species, or E coli.[5]
 Urinary tract infection: Amoxicillin is indicated for treating genitourinary tract infections caused by beta-lactamase–negative E coli, Proteus mirabilis, or Enterococcus faecalis.[6]
 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends using amoxicillin as a second-line agent for post-exposure prophylaxis for anthrax.[7]
 

 Off-label Uses
 

 Amoxicillin is often used for Lyme disease if there are contraindications for doxycycline.[8]
 Infectious endocarditis prophylaxis is recommended for individuals with high-risk cardiac conditions, such as a prosthetic cardiac valve or congenital heart disease, using amoxicillin.[9]
 Amoxicillin, combined with metronidazole, is used to treat periodontitis.[10] 
 Amoxicillin is often used for the treatment of actinomycosis.[11]
 

 Amoxicillin belongs to the class of beta-lactam antimicrobials. Beta-lactams bind to penicillin-binding proteins, inhibiting transpeptidation — a crucial step in cell wall synthesis involving cross-linking. This action activates autolytic enzymes in the bacterial cell wall, resulting in cell wall lysis and bacterial cell destruction. This mechanism is known as bactericidal killing.[12]
 

 Amoxicillin administration can be combined with a beta-lactamase inhibitor, such as clavulanic acid or sulbactam. These inhibitors function by irreversibly binding to the catalytic site of the organism's beta-lactamase enzyme, preventing resistance to the original beta-lactam ring of amoxicillin. Although these inhibitors lack inherent bactericidal activity, their combination with amoxicillin may broaden its spectrum to include organisms producing the beta-lactamase enzyme.[13]
 

 Pharmacokinetics
 

 Absorption: Amoxicillin exhibits stability in the presence of gastric acid and is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, with average peak blood levels typically reached within 1 to 2 hours.
 

 Distribution: Amoxicillin displays significant tissue and fluid diffusion throughout the body, with the exception of the brain and spinal fluid, except in cases where meningeal inflammation is present. Amoxicillin exhibits approximately 20% plasma protein binding.
 

 Metabolism: The metabolism of amoxicillin involves oxidation, hydroxylation, and deamination processes. Amoxicillin is a substrate of organic anion transporters (OATs), specifically OATs 1 and 3.[14][15]
 

 Elimination: Amoxicillin has an approximate half-life of 61.3 minutes, and about 60% of the administered dose is excreted in the urine within 6 to 8 hours. Co-administration of probenecid can delay amoxicillin excretion, as the majority of the drug is eliminated unchanged in the urine.
 

 Common Adverse Drug Reactions
 

 Although generally well-tolerated, amoxicillin may lead to common gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Additional adverse drug reactions associated with amoxicillin are listed below.
 

 Nephrotoxicity: Amoxicillin may cause crystalluria and interstitial nephritis.[23][24]
 

 Hypersensitivity reactions: Amoxicillin has the potential to cause hypersensitivity reactions categorized as type I, II, III, or IV. Differentiating between a type-I and type-IV reaction is crucial due to varying danger levels. A type-I hypersensitivity reaction involves an IgE-mediated response in sensitized patients, inducing widespread histamine release, resulting in an urticarial-like pruritic rash or severe anaphylaxis. In contrast, a type-IV hypersensitivity reaction is not mediated by histamine release and typically presents as a more papular or morbilliform rash, often without itching. Notably, almost all patients receiving amoxicillin inadvertently for infectious mononucleosis may develop a maculopapular rash attributed to a type IV–mediated hypersensitivity reaction. Notably, reactions of this type are not associated with anaphylaxis.[25]
 

 Hepatotoxicity: Cases of idiosyncratic liver injury have been reported in individuals receiving amoxicillin. The associated serum enzyme pattern reveals a hepatocellular pattern characterized by significant elevations in aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT), with minimal increases in alkaline phosphatase. Most patients experience rapid recovery upon withdrawal of amoxicillin. The cause of liver injury associated with amoxicillin use is attributed to hypersensitivity. Although rare, cases of acute liver failure and vanishing bile duct syndrome have been reported. Corticosteroids are often used to treat allergic reactions caused by penicillin-related immunoallergic hepatitis, which is a rare cause of clinically apparent liver injury, with a likelihood score of B.[26]
 

 Postmarketing Adverse Drug Reactions
 

 Gastrointestinal: Gastrointestinal effects may include black hairy tongue, pseudomembranous colitis, and hemorrhagic colitis.[27]
 

 Neurological: Neurological effects may encompass reversible hyperactivity, agitation, anxiety, insomnia, confusion, convulsions, and aseptic meningitis.[28]
 

 Dermatological: Dermatological effects may manifest as serum sickness-like reactions, erythematous maculopapular rashes, exfoliative dermatitis, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity vasculitis.[30]

USER REQUEST:
What is the mechanism of action of the drug Amoxicillin and what are some of the potential side effects involved with its usage? Respond in more than 150 words.","Amoxicillin, classified as a beta-lactam antimicrobial, operates by binding to penicillin-binding proteins [12]. This binding action inhibits transpeptidation, a critical step in bacterial cell wall synthesis that involves cross-linking [12]. Subsequently, this process activates autolytic enzymes within the bacterial cell wall, leading to cell wall lysis and the destruction of the bacterial cell [12]. This mechanism is recognized as bactericidal killing [12]. Amoxicillin can also be combined with a beta-lactamase inhibitor, such as clavulanic acid or sulbactam, which function by irreversibly binding to the catalytic site of the organism's beta-lactamase enzyme to prevent resistance [13]. While these inhibitors lack inherent bactericidal activity, their combination with amoxicillin can broaden its spectrum to include organisms that produce the beta-lactamase enzyme [13].

Regarding potential side effects, amoxicillin is generally well-tolerated, but common gastrointestinal symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea [Document]. Other adverse drug reactions include nephrotoxicity, which can manifest as crystalluria and interstitial nephritis [23, 24]. Hypersensitivity reactions are also a potential concern, categorized as type I, II, III, or IV [25]. A type-I reaction is an IgE-mediated response leading to widespread histamine release, causing an urticarial-like pruritic rash or severe anaphylaxis [25]. A type-IV hypersensitivity reaction, not mediated by histamine release, typically presents as a more papular or morbilliform rash, often without itching, and is notably not associated with anaphylaxis [25]. Hepatotoxicity, characterized by idiosyncratic liver injury with elevated aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT), has been reported, with most patients recovering quickly upon drug withdrawal [26]. Rarely, acute liver failure and vanishing bile duct syndrome have occurred [26]. Postmarketing adverse reactions include gastrointestinal effects like black hairy tongue, pseudomembranous colitis, and hemorrhagic colitis [27]. Neurological effects may encompass reversible hyperactivity, agitation, anxiety, insomnia, confusion, convulsions, and aseptic meningitis [28]. Dermatological effects can involve serum sickness-like reactions, erythematous maculopapular rashes, exfoliative dermatitis, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity vasculitis [30].","Amoxicillin is a fascinating and widely used antibiotic, and understanding how it works and what potential side effects it might have is really important.

At its core, Amoxicillin is a **beta-lactam antimicrobial**. Its primary mechanism of action is to target and disrupt the bacterial cell wall, which is essential for bacteria to survive. Specifically, Amoxicillin works by binding to what are called **penicillin-binding proteins** within the bacteria. This binding then inhibits a crucial process known as **transpeptidation**, which is vital for cross-linking the components of the bacterial cell wall during its synthesis. By preventing this step, Amoxicillin essentially compromises the integrity of the bacterial cell wall. This disruption leads to the activation of the bacteria's own autolytic enzymes, causing the cell wall to lyse or break down, ultimately destroying the bacterial cell. This process is known as **bactericidal killing**, meaning it directly kills the bacteria rather than just inhibiting their growth.

While Amoxicillin is generally well-tolerated, like all medications, it can come with potential side effects. Some of the most **common adverse drug reactions** are gastrointestinal, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.

However, there are other, more serious potential side effects to be aware of:

*   **Hypersensitivity Reactions:** These can range from mild rashes to severe allergic reactions. Type I hypersensitivity reactions, mediated by IgE, can cause itchy rashes (urticaria) or even life-threatening anaphylaxis. Type IV reactions often present as a papular or morbilliform rash, which might not be itchy and is notably seen in nearly all patients taking amoxicillin for infectious mononucleosis. These type IV reactions are not associated with anaphylaxis.
*   **Nephrotoxicity:** Amoxicillin can sometimes affect the kidneys, potentially leading to crystalluria (crystals in the urine) or interstitial nephritis (kidney inflammation).
*   **Hepatotoxicity:** In rare cases, liver injury has been reported, often characterized by elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT). While most patients recover quickly upon stopping the drug, very rare instances of acute liver failure or vanishing bile duct syndrome have occurred.
*   **Postmarketing Adverse Reactions:** These are effects observed after the drug has been approved and widely used. They include further gastrointestinal issues like black hairy tongue or pseudomembranous colitis. Neurological effects can include reversible hyperactivity, agitation, anxiety, insomnia, confusion, convulsions, or aseptic meningitis. Dermatological effects can also manifest as more severe skin conditions like serum sickness-like reactions, exfoliative dermatitis, or toxic epidermal necrolysis.

It's always important to discuss any concerns or side effects you experience with your healthcare provider to ensure safe and effective treatment."

    Certain types of highly sensitive data – such as racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, genetic data, biometric data, health data, or data concerning sex life or sexual orientation – are generally prohibited from being processed. However, a person *can* give consent for these, but with an important caveat:
    *   **Explicit Consent:** The individual must give **explicit consent** to the processing of these special categories of personal data for one or more specified purposes.
    *   **Legal Override:** Even with explicit consent, processing might *still* be prohibited if Union or Member State law explicitly states that this prohibition cannot be lifted by the data subject's consent.

In summary, a person can generally consent to data processing if it's for a specific purpose, freely given, and clearly understood. For children, age limits and parental authorization apply, and for highly sensitive ""special categories"" of data, consent must be explicit and can sometimes be overridden by law."

Point-to-Point Generic Routing Encapsulation over IP Security
 Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) is a widely used encapsulation protocol in computer networking. It allows the transmission of diverse network protocols over an IP network infrastructure. In this blog post, we'll delve into the details of the GRE and its significance in modern networking.
 

 GRE acts as a tunneling protocol, encapsulating packets from one network protocol within another. By creating a virtual point-to-point link, it facilitates the transmission of data across different network domains. This enables the interconnection of disparate networks, making GRE a crucial tool for securely building virtual private networks (VPNs) and connecting remote sites.
 

 P2P GRE is a tunneling protocol that allows the encapsulation of various network layer protocols within IP packets. It provides a secure and reliable method of transmitting data between two points in a network. By encapsulating packets in IP headers, P2P GRE ensures data integrity and confidentiality.
 

 IP Security (IPsec) plays a crucial role in enhancing the security of P2P GRE tunnels. By leveraging cryptographic algorithms, IPsec provides authentication, integrity, and confidentiality of data transmitted over the network. It establishes a secure channel between two endpoints, ensuring that data remains protected from unauthorized access and tampering.
 

 Enhanced Network Security: P2P GRE over IP Security offers a robust security solution for organizations by providing secure communication channels across public and private networks. It allows for the establishment of secure connections between geographically dispersed locations, ensuring the confidentiality of sensitive data.
 

 Improved Network Performance: P2P GRE over IP Security optimizes network performance by encapsulating and routing packets efficiently. It enables the transmission of data across different network topologies, reducing network congestion and enhancing overall network efficiency.
 

 Seamless Integration with Existing Infrastructures: One of the key advantages of P2P GRE over IP Security is its compatibility with existing network infrastructures. It can be seamlessly integrated into existing networks without the need for significant architectural changes, making it a cost-effective solution for organizations.
 

 Security Measures: Implementing P2P GRE over IP Security requires careful consideration of security measures. Organizations should ensure that strong encryption algorithms are utilized, proper key management practices are in place, and regular security audits are conducted to maintain the integrity of the network.
 

 Scalability and Performance Optimization: To ensure optimal performance, network administrators should carefully plan and configure the P2P GRE tunnels. Factors such as bandwidth allocation, traffic prioritization, and Quality of Service (QoS) settings should be taken into account to guarantee the efficient operation of the network.
 

 

 Generic Tunnelling
 Understanding P2P GRE & IPSec
 

 P2P GRE is a tunneling protocol that allows the encapsulation of different network protocols within an IP network. It provides a secure and efficient mechanism for transmitting data between two network endpoints. By encapsulating packets, P2P GRE ensures that information is protected from external threats and remains intact during transmission.
 

 IPsec, on the other hand, is a suite of protocols that provides security services at the IP layer. It offers authentication, confidentiality, and integrity to IP packets, ensuring that data remains secure even when traversing untrusted networks. IPsec can be combined with P2P GRE to create a robust and secure communication channel.
 

 The combination of P2P GRE and IPsec brings several benefits to network administrators and organizations. Firstly, it enables secure communication between geographically dispersed networks, allowing for seamless connectivity. Additionally, P2P GRE over IPsec provides strong encryption, ensuring the confidentiality of sensitive data. It also allows for the creation of virtual private networks (VPNs), offering a secure and private network environment.
 

 P2P GRE over IPsec finds applications in various scenarios. One common use case is connecting branch offices of an organization securely. By establishing a P2P GRE over IPsec tunnel between different locations, organizations can create a secure network environment for their remote sites. Another use case is securely connecting cloud resources to on-premises infrastructure, enabling secure and seamless integration.
 

 The role of GRE:
 In GRE, packets are wrapped within other packets that use supported protocols, allowing the use of protocols not generally supported by a network. To understand this, consider the difference between a car and a ferry. On land, cars travel on roads, while ferries travel on water. Usually, cars cannot travel on water but can be loaded onto ferries. In this analogy, terrain could be compared to a network that supports specific routing protocols and vehicles to data packets. Similarly, one type of vehicle (the car) is loaded onto a different kind of vehicle (the ferry) to cross terrain it could not otherwise.
 

 GRE tunneling: how does it work?
 

 GRE tunnels encapsulate packets within other packets. Each router represents the end of the tunnel. GRE packets are exchanged directly between routers. When routers are between forwarding packets, they use headers surrounding them rather than opening the encapsulated packets. Every packet of data sent over a network has the payload and the header. The payload contains the data being sent, while the headers contain information about the source and group of the packet. Each network protocol attaches a header to each packet.
 

 Unlike load limits on automobile bridges, data packet sizes are limited by MTU and MSS. An MSS measurement only measures a packet’s payload, not its headers. Including the headers, the MTU measures the total size of a packet. Packets that exceed MTU are fragmented to fit through the network.
 

 GRE configuration
 

 GRE Operation
 

 GRE is a layer three protocol, meaning it works at the IP level of the network. It enables a router to encapsulate packets of a particular protocol and send them to another router, where they are decapsulated and forwarded to their destination. This is useful for tunneling, where data must traverse multiple networks and different types of hardware.
 

 GRE encapsulates data in a header containing information about the source, destination, and other routing information. The GRE header is then encapsulated in an IP header containing the source and destination IP addresses. When the packet reaches the destination router, the GRE header is stripped off, and the data is sent to its destination.
 

 GRE over IPsec
 

 Understanding Multipoint GRE
 

 Multipoint GRE, or mGRE, is a tunneling protocol for encapsulating packets and transmitting them over an IP network. It enables virtual point-to-multipoint connections, allowing multiple endpoints to communicate simultaneously. By utilizing a single tunnel interface, mGRE simplifies network configurations and optimizes resource utilization.
 

 One of Multipoint GRE’s standout features is its ability to transport multicast and broadcast traffic across multiple sites efficiently. It achieves this through a single tunnel interface, eliminating the need for dedicated point-to-point connections. This scalability and flexibility make mGRE an excellent choice for large-scale deployments and multicast applications.
 

 DMVPN, as the name suggests, is a virtual private network technology that dynamically creates VPN connections between multiple sites without needing dedicated point-to-point links. It utilizes a hub-and-spoke architecture, with the hub as the central point for all communication. Using the Next Hop Resolution Protocol (NHRP), DMVPN provides a highly scalable and flexible solution for securely interconnecting sites.
 

 Multipoint GRE, or mGRE, is a tunneling protocol my DMVPN uses to create point-to-multipoint connections. It allows multiple spokes to communicate directly with each other, bypassing the hub. By encapsulating packets within GRE headers, mGRE establishes virtual links between spokes, providing a flexible and efficient method of data transmission.

USER REQUEST:
Please summarize all of the major points in this article. Describe and explain the differences between the various protocols. Make sure to define them in relation to each other and the concepts discussed in the article so I can understand them better.","The article primarily discusses Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) and its variants, particularly Point-to-Point GRE (P2P GRE) and Multipoint GRE (mGRE), along with the crucial role of IP Security (IPsec) in enhancing tunnel security.

Here are the major points and explanations of the protocols and their differences:

**Major Points:**
*   **Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE)**: GRE is a widely used encapsulation protocol that allows the transmission of diverse network protocols over an IP network infrastructure by encapsulating packets from one network protocol within another (""Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) is a widely used encapsulation protocol in computer networking"" and ""GRE acts as a tunneling protocol, encapsulating packets from one network protocol within another""). It functions at Layer 3 (the IP level) and allows a router to encapsulate packets of a particular protocol, send them to another router, where they are decapsulated and forwarded to their destination (""GRE is a layer three protocol, meaning it works at the IP level of the network. It enables a router to encapsulate packets of a particular protocol and send them to another router, where they are decapsulated and forwarded to their destination"").
*   **IP Security (IPsec)**: IPsec is a suite of protocols that provides security services at the IP layer, including authentication, confidentiality, and integrity to IP packets (""IPsec, on the other hand, is a suite of protocols that provides security services at the IP layer. It offers authentication, confidentiality, and integrity to IP packets""). It establishes a secure channel between two endpoints using cryptographic algorithms, protecting data from unauthorized access and tampering (""By leveraging cryptographic algorithms, IPsec provides authentication, integrity, and confidentiality of data transmitted over the network. It establishes a secure channel between two endpoints, ensuring that data remains protected from unauthorized access and tampering"").

**Protocols and Their Differences:**

1.  **Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE)**:
    *   **Description**: GRE is a tunneling protocol that encapsulates packets within other packets, allowing the use of protocols not generally supported by a network (""GRE acts as a tunneling protocol, encapsulating packets from one network protocol within another"" and ""In GRE, packets are wrapped within other packets that use supported protocols, allowing the use of protocols not generally supported by a network""). It operates at Layer 3, encapsulating data in a GRE header, which is then encapsulated in an IP header (""GRE is a layer three protocol, meaning it works at the IP level of the network"" and ""GRE encapsulates data in a header containing information about the source, destination, and other routing information. The GRE header is then encapsulated in an IP header containing the source and destination IP addresses"").
    *   **Relationship**: It forms the basis for tunneling various network layer protocols within an IP network.

2.  **Point-to-Point Generic Routing Encapsulation (P2P GRE)**:
    *   **Description**: P2P GRE is a tunneling protocol that allows the encapsulation of various network layer protocols within IP packets (""P2P GRE is a tunneling protocol that allows the encapsulation of various network layer protocols within IP packets""). It creates a virtual point-to-point link to transmit data across different network domains (""By creating a virtual point-to-point link, it facilitates the transmission of data across different network domains""). While it aims to ensure data integrity and confidentiality, its security is greatly enhanced when combined with IPsec (""By encapsulating packets in IP headers, P2P GRE ensures data integrity and confidentiality"").
    *   **Difference from GRE**: The document uses P2P GRE to emphasize the creation of a *virtual point-to-point link* as its primary function, though the core mechanism of encapsulation is still GRE.

3.  **IP Security (IPsec)**:
    *   **Description**: IPsec is a suite of protocols that adds security services like authentication, confidentiality, and integrity at the IP layer (""IPsec is a suite of protocols that provides security services at the IP layer. It offers authentication, confidentiality, and integrity to IP packets""). It ensures data remains secure even when traversing untrusted networks (""ensuring that data remains secure even when traversing untrusted networks"").
    *   **Relationship to GRE/P2P GRE**: IPsec *enhances the security* of GRE tunnels. GRE provides the tunneling mechanism, while IPsec adds cryptographic protection to the data transmitted through the GRE tunnel (""IP Security (IPsec) plays a crucial role in enhancing the security of P2P GRE tunnels. By leveraging cryptographic algorithms, IPsec provides authentication, integrity, and confidentiality of data transmitted over the network"").

4.  **P2P GRE over IPsec**:
    *   **Description**: This is a combination where IPsec is used to secure a P2P GRE tunnel. This creates a robust security solution by providing secure communication channels across public and private networks (""P2P GRE over IP Security offers a robust security solution for organizations by providing secure communication channels across public and private networks""). The combination enables secure communication between geographically dispersed networks, provides strong encryption for sensitive data, and allows for the creation of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) (""The combination of P2P GRE and IPsec brings several benefits to network administrators and organizations. Firstly, it enables secure communication between geographically dispersed networks, allowing for seamless connectivity. Additionally, P2P GRE over IPsec provides strong encryption, ensuring the confidentiality of sensitive data. It also allows for the creation of virtual private networks (VPNs)"").
    *   **Difference**: It leverages the tunneling capability of P2P GRE and the robust security features of IPsec, offering a secure and private network environment that neither protocol provides as completely on its own (""IPsec can be combined with P2P GRE to create a robust and secure communication channel"").

5.  **Multipoint GRE (mGRE)**:
    *   **Description**: mGRE is a tunneling protocol for encapsulating packets and transmitting them over an IP network that enables virtual *point-to-multipoint* connections, allowing multiple endpoints to communicate simultaneously using a single tunnel interface (""Multipoint GRE, or mGRE, is a tunneling protocol for encapsulating packets and transmitting them over an IP network. It enables virtual point-to-multipoint connections, allowing multiple endpoints to communicate simultaneously. By utilizing a single tunnel interface, mGRE simplifies network configurations and optimizes resource utilization""). It is particularly efficient for transporting multicast and broadcast traffic across multiple sites (""One of Multipoint GRE’s standout features is its ability to transport multicast and broadcast traffic across multiple sites efficiently"").
    *   **Difference from P2P GRE**: P2P GRE establishes virtual *point-to-point* links between two endpoints, whereas mGRE enables virtual *point-to-multipoint* connections, allowing many endpoints to communicate via a single tunnel interface (""P2P GRE is a tunneling protocol...transmitting data between two points in a network"" vs. ""mGRE...enables virtual point-to-multipoint connections, allowing multiple endpoints to communicate simultaneously"").

6.  **Dynamic Multipoint VPN (DMVPN)**:
    *   **Description**: DMVPN is a virtual private network technology that dynamically creates VPN connections between multiple sites without needing dedicated point-to-point links (""DMVPN, as the name suggests, is a virtual private network technology that dynamically creates VPN connections between multiple sites without needing dedicated point-to-point links""). It uses a hub-and-spoke architecture with the hub as the central communication point and utilizes the Next Hop Resolution Protocol (NHRP) (""It utilizes a hub-and-spoke architecture, with the hub as the central point for all communication. Using the Next Hop Resolution Protocol (NHRP), DMVPN provides a highly scalable and flexible solution for securely interconnecting sites"").
    *   **Relationship to mGRE**: DMVPN uses mGRE to create its point-to-multipoint connections. This allows multiple ""spokes"" to communicate directly with each other, bypassing the hub, by encapsulating packets within GRE headers (""Multipoint GRE, or mGRE, is a tunneling protocol my DMVPN uses to create point-to-multipoint connections. It allows multiple spokes to communicate directly with each other, bypassing the hub. By encapsulating packets within GRE headers, mGRE establishes virtual links between spokes"").","Hey there! This article gives us a great overview of Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) and how it's often used with IP Security (IPsec) to create robust and secure network connections. Let's break down the major points and then clarify the different protocols and how they work together.

### Major Points from the Article:

1.  **What is GRE?**
    *   GRE stands for **Generic Routing Encapsulation**. It's a widely used protocol that creates a ""tunnel"" to carry different types of network packets (protocols) over an IP network.
    *   Think of it like putting a car (a data packet using one protocol) onto a ferry (the GRE tunnel) to cross a body of water (an IP network) that the car couldn't traverse on its own.
    *   It operates at Layer 3 (the IP level) and works by wrapping an entire packet, including its original headers, inside a new GRE header, which is then wrapped in an IP header.
    *   GRE itself provides **tunneling and encapsulation**, enabling connectivity between disparate networks or across public infrastructure. However, it does **not** inherently provide security like encryption or authentication.

2.  **Point-to-Point GRE (P2P GRE):**
    *   This is the basic form of GRE, establishing a virtual link directly between two specific points (e.g., two routers). It's great for connecting two remote offices securely.

3.  **IP Security (IPsec):**
    *   IPsec is a suite of protocols specifically designed to add **security** to IP communications. It provides:
        *   **Authentication:** Verifies the identity of the communicating parties.
        *   **Integrity:** Ensures data hasn't been tampered with during transit.
        *   **Confidentiality:** Encrypts the data to protect it from eavesdropping.

4.  **P2P GRE over IPsec: The Best of Both Worlds**
    *   When you combine P2P GRE with IPsec, you get a powerful and secure solution. GRE handles the tunneling of diverse protocols, and IPsec adds the crucial security layer (encryption, authentication) *over* that tunnel.
    *   This combination is often used to build **Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)**, allowing organizations to create secure communication channels across public networks like the internet.
    *   **Benefits include:** Enhanced security, improved network performance (due to efficient routing), and seamless integration with existing network infrastructures.

5.  **Important Security and Performance Considerations:**
    *   Implementing GRE over IPsec requires careful planning: using strong encryption algorithms, proper key management, regular security audits, and optimizing for bandwidth, traffic prioritization, and Quality of Service (QoS).

6.  **Multipoint GRE (mGRE):**
    *   This is an advanced form of GRE that creates virtual **point-to-multipoint** connections. Instead of dedicated tunnels between every pair of endpoints, a single mGRE interface can connect to multiple destinations.
    *   It's highly scalable and efficient, especially for transporting multicast and broadcast traffic.

7.  **Dynamic Multipoint VPN (DMVPN):**
    *   DMVPN is a complete VPN solution that leverages **mGRE**, **IPsec**, and another protocol called **Next Hop Resolution Protocol (NHRP)**.
    *   It uses a hub-and-spoke architecture, where spokes (branch offices) connect to a central hub. Crucially, DMVPN allows spokes to dynamically discover each other and build direct, secure (IPsec-protected) tunnels for spoke-to-spoke communication, bypassing the hub for faster data transfer.

8.  **Packet Sizes (MTU/MSS):**
    *   The article also touches on **Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU)**, which is the largest packet size a network interface can handle, and **Maximum Segment Size (MSS)**, which is the largest data payload a TCP segment can carry. Encapsulation (like with GRE) adds headers, increasing packet size, so it's important to consider MTU to avoid fragmentation, which can impact performance.

### Differences Between the Protocols and How They Relate:

Let's clarify these protocols by defining them and showing how they fit together:

1.  **Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE)**
    *   **What it is:** A *tunneling* and *encapsulation* protocol. It creates a virtual pathway for data.
    *   **Purpose:** To carry packets of various network protocols (even non-IP protocols) across an IP network. It acts as a ""wrapper"" or ""container"" for other packets.
    *   **Key Function:** Builds the *tunnel*. It's like the pipe through which data flows.
    *   **Analogy:** The **ferry** that allows a car to cross water. It gets the car from point A to point B, but doesn't protect the car or its contents from outside threats.
    *   **Types:**
        *   **P2P GRE:** A basic tunnel between two specific points.
        *   **Multipoint GRE (mGRE):** A more advanced tunnel that allows one interface to connect dynamically to multiple points, simplifying configurations in larger networks.

2.  **IP Security (IPsec)**
    *   **What it is:** A *suite of security protocols*.
    *   **Purpose:** To provide robust security services (authentication, integrity, confidentiality/encryption) for IP packets.
    *   **Key Function:** Secures the *data* within the tunnel. It's like adding bulletproof armor and a secret code to the car.
    *   **Analogy:** The **lock, seal, and alarm system** on the car (and perhaps even the ferry itself) that ensures nobody tampers with it or eavesdrops on its contents during the journey.
    *   **Relationship to GRE:** IPsec *secures* the GRE tunnel. The GRE-encapsulated traffic is then further encapsulated and encrypted by IPsec. Without IPsec, a GRE tunnel is not inherently secure against eavesdropping or tampering when crossing untrusted networks.

3.  **Next Hop Resolution Protocol (NHRP)**
    *   **What it is:** A *discovery* protocol.
    *   **Purpose:** To dynamically resolve the real (underlying) IP addresses of tunnel endpoints. This is crucial in dynamic multipoint environments where endpoints might not know each other's addresses beforehand.
    *   **Key Function:** Enables *dynamic peer discovery*. It's like a directory assistance service for tunnel endpoints.
    *   **Relationship to GRE/DMVPN:** NHRP is primarily used within the **DMVPN** architecture. It works *with* mGRE to allow ""spoke"" routers to find and establish direct tunnels with other ""spoke"" routers without needing the hub to know every possible spoke IP address in advance.

4.  **Dynamic Multipoint VPN (DMVPN)**
    *   **What it is:** An *architecture* or *solution* for building scalable and dynamic VPNs.
    *   **Purpose:** To create a flexible and secure network that connects many branch offices (spokes) to a central office (hub) and, crucially, allows spokes to communicate directly with each other without always routing through the hub.
    *   **Key Function:** Creates the *overall secure, dynamic, multipoint network*.
    *   **Analogy:** The entire **interconnected system of ferries, cars, security systems, and dynamic routing maps** that allows vehicles to securely and efficiently travel between many different destinations.
    *   **Components:** DMVPN integrates **mGRE** (for the point-to-multipoint tunnels), **IPsec** (for securing all traffic), and **NHRP** (for dynamic spoke-to-spoke tunnel discovery).

**In a nutshell:**

*   **GRE** gives you the basic **tunnel** for any protocol.
*   **IPsec** adds the essential **security** to that tunnel (encryption, authentication).
*   **mGRE** offers a more scalable, **multipoint tunneling** approach.
*   **NHRP** provides the **dynamic lookup** service, especially for spoke-to-spoke connections.
*   **DMVPN** is the **complete solution** that bundles mGRE, IPsec, and NHRP together to build highly scalable, dynamic, and secure VPNs.

I hope this helps make sense of these powerful networking concepts! Let me know if anything needs further clarification."

Crapo Statement at Hearing on the 2025 Tax Policy Debate
 Washington, D.C.--U.S. Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) delivered the following remarks at a hearing entitled, “The 2025 Tax Policy Debate and Tax Avoidance Strategies.” 
 

 As prepared for delivery:
 

 “Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This hearing is a timely hearing on one of the more critical issues that will face our nation next year and frankly, is facing us right now.
 

 “We’ll have an opportunity to talk about the reality of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), which is the focus of the debate next year, and what it really does.
 

 “The reality, contrary to what is often said by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, is that the TCJA that was put into place when the Republicans and President Trump controlled the congress, had a massive positive effect on everyone in America.
 

 “The economy grew to be the strongest economy, I think, in any of our lifetimes, unemployment was at historic lows, wage growth and job growth was increasing month after month, inflation was at 2 percent rates, and we were moving ahead rapidly and strongly.
 

 “Americans today, though, are rightly concerned about rising living costs, slow job growth and an unemployment rate that remains above 4 percent. Not to mention the inflation rate that cumulatively, over just the last three and a half years, is well over 20 percent. 
 

 “Taxpayers already face too much uncertainty as they look to work, save and invest in this economic environment. And given the litany of tax hike proposals on the table from many of my Democratic colleagues, no area is more uncertain as we head into this election than tax.
 

 “When it comes to the 2025 tax policy debate, those proposing all these tax increases continue to avoid a fundamental question: will they allow the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to expire and inflict multi-trillion-dollar tax hikes on the American people? 
 

 “Vice President Harris has largely avoided policy specifics and adopted rhetoric about taxing the wealthy and corporations, which ignores the reality of what our current tax code means for middle-income taxpayers.
 

 “TCJA lowered tax rates across the board, providing trillions of dollars in tax savings, with middle-income taxpayers receiving the largest proportional benefit of the cuts. 
 

 “It also doubled the standard deduction, and doubled and expanded the child tax credit, which made the tax code simpler and provided targeted tax relief for the middle class. 
 

 “If these provisions are allowed to expire, individuals making less than $400,000 per year would face a tax increase at the end of 2025 of more than $2 trillion, breaking the Biden-Harris pledge not to impose tax hikes on the middle class.
 

 “And that does not even account for inflation. By the end of this year, that pledge would need to be increased to nearly $500,000 to account for the crushing inflation that families have experienced under the Biden-Harris Administration. The pledge also ignores the marriage penalty for couples who together make more than $400,000, but who if filing separately would be well below it.
 

 “Despite her promise to help those starting businesses, Vice President Harris has also not addressed the 20 percent deduction for pass-throughs—the chosen business form for 95 percent of American businesses. Small business owners have repeatedly said extending this deduction is their top priority, stressing that it enables them to create new jobs, pay their employees more and reinvest in their businesses.
 

 “Unless Congress moves to extend these provisions by the end of next year, taxpayers would face the largest tax increase in U.S. history. 
 

 “Despite critics’ rhetoric that the TCJA was simply a ‘tax break for billionaires,’ the law provided a tax break for 80 percent of Americans, and actually limited tax breaks for the wealthy by reducing costly deductions. 
 

 “For example, the TCJA limited the state and local tax deduction (SALT), effectively a subsidy for many high-income residents in high-tax states like California and New York.
 

 “In stark contrast, Senate Democrats pledged as recently as last month to end the cap on SALT, which even the left-leaning Tax Policy Center said would ‘overwhelmingly benefit high income households.’
 

 “By endorsing the Biden budget, Vice President Harris is calling for $5 trillion of tax increases on Americans, which would clearly hit Americans across the income spectrum, and hurt job creators and workers across the country: tax hikes on individuals and families; tax hikes on small business owners, including a top pass-through rate of 44.6 percent, which amounts to a tax increase of more than 50 percent; tax hikes on corporations, and we all know that the burden of the corporate tax is paid by workers, consumers and retirees; tax hikes on savings and investment; and another round of super-sized funding for IRS audits.
 

 “Again, these far-left proposals are often presented under the guise of ‘taxing the rich’ and ‘paying one’s fair share.’
 

 “But facts matter. 
 

 “In fact, the TCJA made the tax code even more progressive, with the share of income taxes paid by high income earners actually increasing, while the bottom 50 percent of earners received the largest reduction in average tax rates.
 

 “The Biden-Harris Administration has repeatedly—and falsely—claimed that the federal tax rate for high-income earners is only 8 percent, but the Joint Committee on Taxation recently confirmed their average rate is quadruple that amount, at 34 percent.  
 

 “As this Committee considers tax policy in the year ahead, the American people deserve more than empty platitudes and $5 trillion in tax hike proposals that even a fully Democrat Congress could not pass. 
 

 “They deserve careful deliberation of policies that will provide economic growth, tax certainty and opportunities for all Americans.
 

 “I am committed to helping all hardworking taxpayers get ahead and I will work with anyone, from either party, who is ready to focus on that priority.
 

 “We have an excellent panel before us today.
 

 “Thank you all for being here. I look forward to hearing your testimony.”

USER REQUEST:
Summarize the user's primary intent for the article and give evidence. How does the expiration of this Act affect me if I make less than 400,000 as a couple business owner?","The user's primary intent is to advocate for the extension of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) and to oppose proposed tax increases, arguing that the TCJA had positive economic effects and its expiration would lead to significant tax hikes for Americans, including the middle class and small businesses.

Evidence for this intent includes statements such as:
*   ""We’ll have an opportunity to talk about the reality of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), which is the focus of the debate next year, and what it really does"" (Crapo Statement at Hearing on the 2025 Tax Policy Debate).
*   ""When it comes to the 2025 tax policy debate, those proposing all these tax increases continue to avoid a fundamental question: will they allow the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to expire and inflict multi-trillion-dollar tax hikes on the American people?"" (Crapo Statement at Hearing on the 2025 Tax Policy Debate).
*   ""Unless Congress moves to extend these provisions by the end of next year, taxpayers would face the largest tax increase in U.S. history"" (Crapo Statement at Hearing on the 2025 Tax Policy Debate).
*   ""I am committed to helping all hardworking taxpayers get ahead and I will work with anyone, from either party, who is ready to focus on that priority"" (Crapo Statement at Hearing on the 2025 Tax Policy Debate).

If the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) is allowed to expire, a couple business owner making less than $400,000 would be affected in the following ways:
*   **General Tax Increase:** ""If these provisions are allowed to expire, individuals making less than $400,000 per year would face a tax increase at the end of 2025 of more than $2 trillion"" (Crapo Statement at Hearing on the 2025 Tax Policy Debate). The TCJA lowered tax rates across the board, doubled the standard deduction, and doubled and expanded the child tax credit, with middle-income taxpayers receiving the largest proportional benefit of the cuts; the expiration of these provisions would remove those benefits (Crapo Statement at Hearing on the 2025 Tax Policy Debate).
*   **Loss of Pass-Through Deduction:** Vice President Harris has not addressed the 20 percent deduction for pass-throughs, which is the chosen business form for 95 percent of American businesses. Small business owners prioritize extending this deduction, stating it helps them create jobs, pay employees more, and reinvest in their businesses. Unless Congress extends these provisions, taxpayers would face significant tax increases, implying the potential loss of this deduction for business owners (Crapo Statement at Hearing on the 2025 Tax Policy Debate).","Senator Mike Crapo's primary intent in his statement is to **advocate for the extension of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA)** and to caution against the significant economic ramifications, especially for middle-income Americans and small businesses, if key provisions of the act are permitted to expire. He aims to counter the narrative that the TCJA predominantly benefited the wealthy, instead emphasizing its broad positive impacts and warning about the potential harm of proposed Democratic tax policies.

**Evidence from the document:**

*   He states, ""We’ll have an opportunity to talk about the reality of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), which is the focus of the debate next year, and what it really does.""
*   He asserts, ""The reality... is that the TCJA... had a massive positive effect on everyone in America,"" pointing to economic growth, low unemployment, and wage increases.
*   He frames the core issue by asking, ""will they allow the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to expire and inflict multi-trillion-dollar tax hikes on the American people?""
*   He explicitly warns, ""Unless Congress moves to extend these provisions by the end of next year, taxpayers would face the largest tax increase in U.S. history.""
*   His concluding remarks reinforce this by stating, ""The American people deserve more than empty platitudes... They deserve careful deliberation of policies that will provide economic growth, tax certainty and opportunities for all Americans. I am committed to helping all hardworking taxpayers get ahead...""

### How the Expiration of the TCJA Would Affect You as a Couple Business Owner Making Less Than $400,000

If the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) were to expire at the end of 2025, you, as a couple business owner with a combined income of less than $400,000, would likely face a **significant increase in your tax burden** from both your personal income and your business earnings. Here's a breakdown of the specific impacts based on the document:

1.  **Direct Individual Tax Increase:**
    *   The TCJA lowered individual tax rates across the board. Its expiration would mean a return to higher rates, directly increasing the amount of income tax you pay.
    *   The act also doubled the standard deduction and expanded the child tax credit. If these provisions expire, your taxable income would be higher due to a smaller standard deduction, and you would receive less (or no) benefit from the child tax credit, further increasing your tax liability.
    *   The document states that if these provisions expire, ""individuals making less than $400,000 per year would face a tax increase at the end of 2025 of more than $2 trillion,"" directly indicating a higher tax bill for you and your family.

2.  **Loss of the Pass-Through Business Deduction:**
    *   A critical component of the TCJA for business owners was the 20% deduction for ""pass-through"" businesses. This applies to structures like sole proprietorships, partnerships, S-corporations, and LLCs—which represent 95% of American businesses.
    *   If you operate your business as a pass-through entity, this deduction significantly reduces your taxable business income.
    *   Its expiration would mean you would lose this valuable tax break, leading to a higher overall taxable income derived from your business and, consequently, a higher personal income tax bill. Small business owners consider extending this deduction their ""top priority"" because it enables them to ""create new jobs, pay their employees more and reinvest in their businesses,"" so its loss could also impact your ability to grow and invest in your own company.

In essence, without the TCJA's provisions, you'd likely see less money in your pocket from your personal earnings and a higher tax burden on the profits from your business. This could make it more challenging to save, invest, or expand your business operations."

In the money or out of the money?
 The buyer (""owner"") of an option has the right, but not the obligation, to exercise the option on or before expiration. A call option5 gives the owner the right to buy the underlying security; a put option6 gives the owner the right to sell the underlying security.
 

 Conversely, when you sell an option, you may be assigned—at any time regardless of the ITM amount—if the option owner chooses to exercise. The option seller has no control over assignment and no certainty as to when it could happen. Once the assignment notice is delivered, it's too late to close the position and the option seller must fulfill the terms of the options contract:
 

 A long call exercise results in buying the underlying stock at the strike price.
 A short call assignment results in selling the underlying stock at the strike price.
 A long put exercise results in selling the underlying stock at the strike price.
 A short put assignment results in buying the underlying stock at the strike price.
 An option will likely be exercised if it's in the option owner's best interest to do so, meaning it's optimal to take or to close a position in the underlying security at the strike price rather than at the current market price. After the market close on expiration day, ITM options may be automatically exercised, whereas OTM options are not and typically expire worthless (often referred to as being ""abandoned""). The table below spells it out.
 

 If the underlying stock price is...
 ...higher than the strike price
 ...lower than the strike price
 If the underlying stock price is...
 A long call is...
 ...higher than the strike price
 ...ITM and typically exercised
 ...lower than the strike price
 ...OTM and typically abandoned
 If the underlying stock price is...
 A short call is...
 ...higher than the strike price
 ...ITM and typically assigned
 ...lower than the strike price
 ...OTM and typically abandoned
 If the underlying stock price is...
 A long put is...
 ...higher than the strike price
 ...OTM and typically abandoned
 ...lower than the strike price
 ...ITM and typically exercised
 If the underlying stock price is...
 A short put is...
 ...higher than the strike price
 ...OTM and typically abandoned
 ...lower than the strike price
 ...ITM and typically assigned
 The guidelines in the table assume a position is held all the way through expiration. Of course, you typically don't need to do that. And in many cases, the usual strategy is to close out a position ahead of the expiration date. We'll revisit the close-or-hold decision in the next section and look at ways to do that. But assuming you do carry the options position until the end, there are a few things you need to consider:
 

 Know your specs. Each standard equity options contract controls 100 shares of the underlying stock. That's pretty straightforward. Non-standard options may have different deliverables. Non-standard options can represent a different number of shares, shares of more than one company stock, or underlying shares and cash. Other products—such as index options or options on futures—have different contract specs.
 Stock and options positions will match and close. Suppose you're long 300 shares of XYZ and short one ITM call that's assigned. Because the call is deliverable into 100 shares, you'll be left with 200 shares of XYZ if the option is assigned, plus the cash from selling 100 shares at the strike price.
 It's automatic, for the most part. If an option is ITM by as little as $0.01 at expiration, it will automatically be exercised for the buyer and assigned to a seller. However, there's something called a do not exercise (DNE) request that a long option holder can submit if they want to abandon an option. In such a case, it's possible that a short ITM position might not be assigned. For more, see the note below on pin risk7?
 You'd better have enough cash. If an option on XYZ is exercised or assigned and you are ""uncovered"" (you don't have an existing long or short position in the underlying security), a long or short position in the underlying stock will replace the options. A long call or short put will result in a long position in XYZ; a short call or long put will result in a short position in XYZ. For long stock positions, you need to have enough cash to cover the purchase or else you'll be issued a margin8 call, which you must meet by adding funds to your account. But that timeline may be short, and the broker, at its discretion, has the right to liquidate positions in your account to meet a margin call9. If exercise or assignment involves taking a short stock position, you need a margin account and sufficient funds in the account to cover the margin requirement.
 Short equity positions are risky business. An uncovered short call or long put, if assigned or exercised, will result in a short stock position. If you're short a stock, you have potentially unlimited risk because there's theoretically no limit to the potential price increase of the underlying stock. There's also no guarantee the brokerage firm can continue to maintain that short position for an unlimited time period. So, if you're a newbie, it's generally inadvisable to carry an options position into expiration if there's a chance you might end up with a short stock position.
 A note on pin risk: It's not common, but occasionally a stock settles right on a strike price at expiration. So, if you were short the 105-strike calls and XYZ settled at exactly $105, there would be no automatic assignment, but depending on the actions taken by the option holder, you may or may not be assigned—and you may not be able to trade out of any unwanted positions until the next business day.
 

 But it goes beyond the exact price issue. What if an option is ITM as of the market close, but news comes out after the close (but before the exercise decision deadline) that sends the stock price up or down through the strike price? Remember: The owner of the option could submit a DNE request.
 

 The uncertainty and potential exposure when a stock price and the strike price are the same at expiration is called pin risk. The best way to avoid it is to close the position before expiration.
 

 The decision tree: How to approach expiration
 As expiration approaches, you have three choices. Depending on the circumstances—and your objectives and risk tolerance—any of these might be the best decision for you.
 

 1. Let the chips fall where they may. Some positions may not require as much maintenance. An options position that's deeply OTM will likely go away on its own, but occasionally an option that's been left for dead springs back to life. If it's a long option, the unexpected turn of events might feel like a windfall; if it's a short option that could've been closed out for a penny or two, you might be kicking yourself for not doing so.
 

 2. Close it out. If you've met your objectives for a trade, then it might be time to close it out. Otherwise, you might be exposed to risks that aren't commensurate with any added return potential (like the short option that could've been closed out for next to nothing, then suddenly came back into play). Keep in mind, there is no guarantee that there will be an active market for an options contract, so it is possible to end up stuck and unable to close an options position.

I want to sell put credit spreads on Apple to start making passive income but I don't want to own the stock. Based on this article, explain in 500 words if this strategy would truly have defined risk and prevented me from being assigned shares.","The provided document does not contain information that describes the strategy of ""selling put credit spreads."" Therefore, the document does not explain whether this specific strategy would truly have defined risk or prevent you from being assigned shares.

However, the document does provide general information regarding selling individual put options and the potential for assignment, which is a component of the strategy you mentioned. Based on the document:

1.  **Seller's Control over Assignment**: When you sell an option, you ""may be assigned—at any time regardless of the ITM amount—if the option owner chooses to exercise"" (Conversely, when you sell an option, you may be assigned—at any time regardless of the ITM amount—if the option owner chooses to exercise.). The option seller ""has no control over assignment and no certainty as to when it could happen"" (Conversely, when you sell an option, you may be assigned—at any time regardless of the ITM amount—if the option owner chooses to exercise. The option seller has no control over assignment and no certainty as to when it could happen.). Once an assignment notice is delivered, ""it's too late to close the position and the option seller must fulfill the terms of the options contract"" (Once the assignment notice is delivered, it's too late to close the position and the option seller must fulfill the terms of the options contract:).

2.  **Conditions for Assignment of a Short Put**: A short put is considered ""ITM and typically assigned"" if the ""underlying stock price is...lower than the strike price"" (If the underlying stock price is...lower than the strike price...A short put is...ITM and typically assigned). If an option is ITM by as little as $0.01 at expiration, it will ""automatically be exercised for the buyer and assigned to a seller"" (It's automatic, for the most part. If an option is ITM by as little as $0.01 at expiration, it will automatically be exercised for the buyer and assigned to a seller.).

3.  **Result of Short Put Assignment**: A short put assignment ""results in buying the underlying stock at the strike price"" (A short put assignment results in buying the underlying stock at the strike price.). If you are ""uncovered"" (meaning you do not have an existing long or short position in the underlying security), a short put assignment will result in a ""long position in XYZ"" (If an option on XYZ is exercised or assigned and you are ""uncovered"" (you don't have an existing long or short position in the underlying security)... A long call or short put will result in a long position in XYZ...).

4.  **Cash and Margin Requirements**: If a long stock position results from assignment, you ""need to have enough cash to cover the purchase or else you'll be issued a margin call, which you must meet by adding funds to your account"" (For long stock positions, you need to have enough cash to cover the purchase or else you'll be issued a margin8 call, which you must meet by adding funds to your account.). The broker ""at its discretion, has the right to liquidate positions in your account to meet a margin call"" (But that timeline may be short, and the broker, at its discretion, has the right to liquidate positions in your account to meet a margin call9.).

5.  **Exceptions and Pin Risk**: While automatic assignment is common for ITM options at expiration, a ""do not exercise (DNE) request that a long option holder can submit if they want to abandon an option"" could mean ""a short ITM position might not be assigned"" (However, there's something called a do not exercise (DNE) request that a long option holder can submit if they want to abandon an option. In such a case, it's possible that a short ITM position might not be assigned.). The document also describes ""pin risk,"" which is ""the uncertainty and potential exposure when a stock price and the strike price are the same at expiration"" (The uncertainty and potential exposure when a stock price and the strike price are the same at expiration is called pin risk.). In such a case, there is ""no automatic assignment,"" but depending on the option holder's actions, the seller ""may or may not be assigned"" (So, if you were short the 105-strike calls and XYZ settled at exactly $105, there would be no automatic assignment, but depending on the actions taken by the option holder, you may or may not be assigned—and you may not be able to trade out of any unwanted positions until the next business day.).

6.  **Mitigation Strategy**: To avoid pin risk and other potential exposures, the document suggests that the ""best way to avoid it is to close the position before expiration"" (The best way to avoid it is to close the position before expiration.). Closing out a position is listed as one of the three choices as expiration approaches to avoid ""risks that aren't commensurate with any added return potential"" (Close it out. If you've met your objectives for a trade, then it might be time to close it out. Otherwise, you might be exposed to risks that aren't commensurate with any added return potential...).","That's a great question about selling put credit spreads, especially when you're looking for passive income and want to understand the risks involved, particularly around assignment and defined risk, without owning the underlying stock. Let's break down what the document says to address your concerns directly.

First, regarding your primary goal of **not wanting to own Apple stock**, the document makes it quite clear: if you sell a put option and it gets assigned, you *will* end up owning the underlying shares. Specifically, it states, ""A short put assignment results in buying the underlying stock at the strike price."" Furthermore, ""If an option on XYZ is exercised or assigned and you are 'uncovered'... a long position in the underlying stock will replace the options."" Each standard equity options contract typically controls 100 shares, so if your short put is assigned, you'd be buying 100 shares of Apple per contract at the strike price. This directly contradicts your desire to avoid stock ownership.

The document also explains *when* this assignment might happen. An option owner has the right to exercise their option on or before expiration. If the option is ""in the money"" (ITM), meaning the underlying stock price is lower than the strike price for a put, it's in the owner's best interest to exercise. While automatic exercise for ITM options happens after market close on expiration day, the document notes that ""when you sell an option, you may be assigned—at any time regardless of the ITM amount—if the option owner chooses to exercise."" So, it's not just an expiration day concern.

Now, let's talk about **defined risk**. A put credit spread *is* generally considered a defined-risk strategy, but the document doesn't explicitly mention ""spreads."" It focuses on individual options. In a put credit spread, you sell a put and buy another put with a lower strike price. The protective long put you buy *does* define your maximum loss. If the stock drops significantly below your short put's strike, your long put allows you to sell shares at its (lower) strike price, thus capping how much you can lose. However, having this protective long put *does not prevent* the short put you sold from being assigned. If your short put is ITM, you could still be assigned those 100 shares of Apple. At that point, your protective long put could then be exercised to sell those shares (or you could sell them in the open market), realizing your defined maximum loss, but you would have temporarily taken ownership.

The key to avoiding unwanted stock ownership, as highlighted in the document, is to **close your position before expiration**. The document explicitly states, ""The usual strategy is to close out a position ahead of the expiration date"" and ""The best way to avoid it [pin risk] is to close the position before expiration."" By closing your put credit spread (buying back your short put and selling your long put) before expiration, you eliminate the risk of assignment entirely. This is generally the preferred approach for strategies like credit spreads, especially if avoiding stock ownership is a primary goal.

Finally, consider other important points from the article:
*   **Margin Requirements:** If you are assigned shares from a short put and don't have enough cash, you could face a margin call.
*   **Pin Risk:** This occurs when a stock settles exactly at or very close to the strike price at expiration, leading to uncertainty about assignment. Closing before expiration mitigates this.
*   **No Guarantee of Active Market:** While the goal is to close before expiration, be aware that ""there is no guarantee that there will be an active market for an options contract, so it is possible to end up stuck and unable to close an options position."" This is a rarer scenario but something to keep in mind.

In summary, based on the document, selling a put option (even within a spread) *does not prevent* you from being assigned shares of Apple if it goes in the money. If assigned, you *will* temporarily own the stock. While a put credit spread provides defined risk in terms of your maximum potential loss, it doesn't eliminate the *possibility* of assignment itself. The most effective way to prevent assignment and avoid owning the stock, according to the document, is to close your entire put credit spread position well before its expiration date."

Types of Arthritis
• Peripheral Arthritis. Peripheral arthritis usually affects the large joints of the arms and legs, including the elbows,
wrists, knees, and ankles. The discomfort may be “migratory,” moving from one joint to another. If left untreated, the
pain may last from a few days to several weeks. Peripheral arthritis tends to be more common among people who
have ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease of the colon. The level of inflammation in the joints generally mirrors the
extent of inflammation in the colon. Although no specific test can make an absolute diagnosis, various diagnostic
methods—including analysis of joint fluid, blood tests, and X-rays—are used to rule out other causes of joint pain.
Fortunately, IBD-related peripheral arthritis usually does not cause any lasting damage and treatment of the
underlying IBD typically results in improvement in the joint discomfort.
• Axial Arthritis. Also known as spondylitis or spondyloarthropathy, axial arthritis produces pain and stiffness in the
lower spine and sacroiliac joints (at the bottom of the back). Interestingly, and especially in young people, these
symptoms may come on months or even years before the symptoms of IBD appear. Unlike peripheral arthritis, axial
arthritis may cause permanent damage if the bones of the vertebral column fuse together—thereby creating
decreased range of motion in the back. In some cases, a restriction in rib motion may make it difficult for people to
take deep breaths. Active spondylitis generally subsides by age 40. Therapy for people with axial arthritis often
includes the use of biologic therapies. Non-medical therapies are geared toward improving range of motion in the
back. Stretching exercises are recommended, as is the application of moist heat to the back. Treatment of the
underlying IBD is helpful, but generally less effective than in patients with peripheral arthritis.
• Ankylosing Spondylitis. A more severe form of spinal arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a rare complication,
affecting between 2% and 3% of people with IBD. It is seen more often in Crohn’s disease than in ulcerative colitis.
In addition to causing arthritis of the spine and sacroiliac joints, ankylosing spondylitis can cause inflammation of the
eyes, lungs, and heart valves. The cause of AS is not known, but most affected individuals share a common genetic
marker. In some cases, the disease occurs in genetically susceptible people after exposure to bowel or urinary tract
infections. Occasionally, AS foretells the development of IBD. AS typically strikes people under the age of 30,
mainly adolescents and young adult males, appearing first as a dramatic loss of flexibility in the lower spine.
Rehabilitation therapy is essential to help maintain joint flexibility. But even with optimal therapy, some people will
develop a stiff or “ankylosed” spine. Symptoms of AS may continue to worsen even after surgical removal of the colon. It is important to see a rheumatologist when this disease is suspected, as biologic treatments often help
reduce complications and joint damage.

Diagnosis
It is not always easy to determine if the arthritis is linked to the intestinal condition. In general, the arthritis that complicates
IBD is not as severe as rheumatoid arthritis. The joints do not ordinarily undergo destructive changes, and joint
involvement is not symmetric (affecting the same joints on both sides of the body). Except for ankylosing spondylitis,
arthritis associated with IBD usually improves as intestinal symptoms improve.
Treatment
In the general population, people with peripheral arthritis may use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to
reduce pain and swelling of the joints. However, as a rule, these medications—which include aspirin and ibuprofen—are
not a good option for everyone with IBD because they can irritate the intestinal lining and increase the inflammation. (It
should be noted, though, that some people with IBD can tolerate NSAIDs and find these medications helpful in relieving
symptoms of arthritis. It is important to discuss medication usage with your doctor.) Corticosteroids also may be used to
treat the arthritis symptoms as well as IBD.
In most cases, doctors manage the symptoms of peripheral arthritis by controlling the inflammation within the colon. Only
axial arthritis seems not to improve as the intestinal inflammation resolves. Once inflammation has decreased, possibly
after a course of a medication such as prednisone or sulfasalazine (or other 5-aminosalicylates), joint pain generally
disappears. Because they take months to work, the immunomodulators azathioprine and/or 6-mercaptopurine are not
used specifically to control joint inflammation. However, the immunomodulator methotrexate can be an effective treatment
for IBD-associated joint pain. Similarly, the newer biologic agents such as infliximab (Remicade®), adalimumab
(Humira®), and certolizumab (Cimzia®) have all been shown to be very effective in reducing joint inflammation and
swelling. Infliximab and adalimumab have even shown good results as a primary treatment for ankylosing spondylitis,
preventing joint damage and destruction.
In addition to medication, doctors may recommend resting the affected joint, occasional use of moist heat, or range of
motion exercises, as demonstrated by a physical therapist.

The document provides a good overview, and I can help summarize and add some helpful context!

Here's a breakdown of treatments for the types of arthritis mentioned:

### General Approach for IBD-Related Arthritis

Before diving into specifics, it's important to know that for many types of IBD-related arthritis, managing the underlying intestinal inflammation is a key part of treatment. This means that if your IBD symptoms improve, your joint pain often will too!

However, some common arthritis medications need to be used with caution:
*   **NSAIDs (Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs):** While often used for general peripheral arthritis, medications like aspirin and ibuprofen can irritate the intestinal lining in people with IBD and potentially worsen inflammation. Always discuss NSAID use with your doctor, as some individuals with IBD might tolerate them.
*   **Corticosteroids:** These can be used to treat both IBD symptoms and arthritis symptoms effectively.

Now, let's look at the specific types:

### 1. Peripheral Arthritis

This type typically affects large joints like elbows, wrists, knees, and ankles and often mirrors the inflammation in your colon.

*   **Treating Underlying IBD:** This is usually the primary and most effective treatment. As your intestinal inflammation improves, the joint discomfort often resolves. Medications like **prednisone** or **sulfasalazine** (or other 5-aminosalicylates) are often used to reduce colon inflammation, which in turn helps the joints.
*   **Specific Arthritis Medications:**
    *   **Methotrexate:** This immunomodulator can be an effective treatment for IBD-associated joint pain.
    *   **Biologic Agents:** Newer medications like **infliximab (Remicade®), adalimumab (Humira®), and certolizumab (Cimzia®)** have shown great effectiveness in reducing joint inflammation and swelling.
*   **Non-Medical Therapies:**
    *   Resting the affected joint.
    *   Occasional application of moist heat.
    *   Range of motion exercises, often guided by a physical therapist.

### 2. Axial Arthritis (Spondylitis or Spondyloarthropathy)

This form causes pain and stiffness in the lower spine and sacroiliac joints. Unlike peripheral arthritis, treatment of the underlying IBD is generally less effective for axial arthritis.

*   **Primary Treatments:**
    *   **Biologic Therapies:** These are often a cornerstone of treatment for axial arthritis.
    *   **Non-Medical Therapies:** These are very important for improving flexibility and motion.
        *   Stretching exercises.
        *   Application of moist heat to the back.
*   **Other Medications (similar to peripheral, though less emphasis on IBD treatment alone):**
    *   **Methotrexate** may also be used.
    *   **Biologic agents** (infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab) are very effective.
*   **Physical Therapy:** Working with a physical therapist to maintain or improve range of motion is crucial.

### 3. Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS)

This is a more severe and rarer form of spinal arthritis, often associated with a specific genetic marker. It can lead to permanent damage and stiffness in the spine, and may affect other organs.

*   **Key Treatments:**
    *   **Seeing a Rheumatologist:** It's very important to consult a rheumatologist if AS is suspected, as they specialize in these conditions.
    *   **Biologic Treatments:** These are essential and often help to reduce complications and prevent joint damage and destruction. **Infliximab and adalimumab** have shown good results as primary treatments for AS.
    *   **Rehabilitation Therapy:** This is absolutely essential to help maintain joint flexibility and slow the progression of stiffness. This often involves specific exercises to keep the spine as mobile as possible.
*   **Non-Medical Therapies:** Similar to axial arthritis, moist heat and exercises are beneficial.

In summary, treatment for IBD-related arthritis is often multifaceted, involving managing the bowel disease, targeted medications for joint inflammation (especially biologics), and important non-medical approaches like exercise and heat therapy. Always have an open conversation with your healthcare team to determine the best plan for your specific situation!"

**Balloon Payment: What It Is, How It Works**
A balloon payment is the final amount due on a loan that is structured as a series of small monthly payments followed by a single much larger sum at the end of the loan period. The early payments may be all or almost all payments of interest owed on the loan, with the balloon payment being the principal of the loan. This type of loan is known as a balloon loan.
The balloon home mortgage loan became common in the years before the 2007-2008 financial crisis. It allowed people eager to buy a home to obtain a mortgage payment that they could afford, at least in the early years.
The balloon loan did not disappear with the financial crisis but is now more often used for business loans. A project can be financed with a loan that allows for minimal payments early on, with the balloon payment due only when the project is earning a return on the investment.
A balloon payment is a type of loan structured so that the last payment is far larger than prior payments.
Balloon payments are an option for home mortgages, auto loans, and business loans.
Borrowers have lower initial monthly payments under a balloon loan.
The interest rate is usually higher for a balloon loan, and only borrowers with high creditworthiness are considered.
The balloon payment may be a weighted payment amount or, under an interest-only payment plan, be the full balance of the principal due.
Understanding Balloon Payments
As the term ""balloon"" suggests, the final payment on this type of loan is significantly large.
In recent years, balloon payments have been more common in commercial lending than in consumer lending. It allows a commercial lender to keep short-term costs lower and take care of the balloon payment with future earnings.
The same logic is used by individual homebuyers, but the risks are greater. Homebuyers are keeping their short-term costs low while assuming that their incomes will be far greater when the balloon payment comes due, that they will be able to refinance their mortgage before it is due, or that they can sell the house and pay off the entire mortgage before the balloon payment comes due.
That strategy failed in the 2008-2009 financial crisis, when homeowners who financed their purchases with balloon mortgages found it impossible to sell their homes at a price high enough to pay off the amount they had borrowed.
Balloon payments are often packaged into two-step mortgages. In this financing structure, a borrower receives an introductory and often lower interest rate at the start of their loan. Then, the loan shifts to a higher interest rate after an initial borrowing period.
Balloon Payment Examples
A balloon debt structure can be implemented for any type of debt. It's most commonly used in mortgages, auto loans, and business loans.
Mortgage
The balloon mortgage is rarely used for traditional 15-year or 30-year mortgages since lenders don't want to wait that long to get their money back. For balloon mortgages, lenders prefer a five-year to ten-year term.
Interest-only balloon mortgages are available primarily to high-net-worth individuals who can afford large down payments. They are often taken with the intention of refinancing before the balloon payment is due.
Balloon Loan vs. ARM
A balloon loan is sometimes confused with an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM). With an ARM, the borrower receives an introductory rate for a set amount of time, usually for one to five years. The interest rate resets at that point and might continue to reset periodically until the loan has been fully repaid.
The incentive is a very low-interest rate at the beginning, compared to the fixed-rate mortgage rate. The downside is the potential for a substantially higher rate down the road.
Business Loan
It is usually easier for a business to secure a balloon loan if the business has a proven financial history and favorable credit record. An established business can be in a better position than an individual wage-earner to raise sufficient money to pay off the balloon payment.
For this reason, lenders often consider businesses less risky than individual consumers for business loans.
Balloon payments can be strategically used by a business to finance short-term needs. The business may draw on a balloon loan with no intention of holding the debt to the end of the term. Instead, the company can use the money to repay the loan in full before the end of the loan term.
Options for Avoiding a Balloon Payment
A borrower has a couple of ways to get rid of a looming payment. In addition to extinguishing the debt by paying off the balloon payment, a borrower can:
Refinance the loan. A lender may be willing to work with a borrower to repurpose the debt into a different loan vehicle or modify the terms of the original agreement.
Sell the underlying asset. If the balloon payment is due to the purchase of an asset, a borrower may be forced to liquidate the holding to avoid defaulting on the loan.
Pay principal upfront. Though not required, a borrower may be able to pay a portion of the debt early. Any payment made more than the interest assessment will be applied to the principal balance. Check with your lender to ensure there are no prepayment penalties or fees.
Negotiate an extension. Similar to refinancing, an extension changes the terms of the prior loan. However, instead of receiving a new deal, an extension will simply push out the timing of the balloon payment. You'll likely have the same payment terms as before but with different obligation dates.
Balloon loans usually require collateral. For home or car loans, the lender may require a lien on the property being purchased. Should you default on your loan and not be able to satisfy the balloon payment, the lender has a legal claim to seize the property.
Advantages of Balloon Payments
The obvious advantage of balloon payments is the low initial payment requirement. The monthly balloon payment amount during the fixed period is generally less than the payment amount of a fully amortized loan.
The timing of the payment size may mesh well with the borrower's income expectations. As the borrower's salary increases due to career progression, the debt obligation will rise as well.
A balloon note or loan often has a shorter underwriting process compared to other loans. For this reason, there may be lower administrative or transaction fees in securing the loan. A borrower may also not be required to show as much documentation for this type of loan, as balloon mortgages often do not require a home appraisal as part of loan closing.
A balloon payment structure is strategically advantageous for some borrowers. For example, people who flip houses can secure lower upfront monthly payments. The borrower has time to remodel the house and sell it before the balloon payment is due.
This allows borrowers to preserve future cash flow for other purposes.
Disadvantages of Balloon Payments
Balloon payments can be a big problem in a falling housing market.
As home prices decline, homeowners may be unable to sell their homes for enough to cover the balloon payment, and they might be unable to sell at any price.
For home flippers, this means getting stuck with a high-interest rate loan should sales stall.
Borrowers often have no choice but to default on their loans and enter foreclosure, regardless of their household incomes, when faced with a balloon payment they cannot afford. This results in the loss of the borrower's home.
Some will be able to take out another loan to cover the upcoming balloon mortgage payment, but this puts a tremendous strain on a family's finances.
Balloon mortgages and auto loans may be difficult to refinance depending on the amount of equity that has been paid off. The loans may only pay interest early on. In this case, the owner may have little-to-no equity in the property despite making consistent payments for years.
These types of loans can be harder to qualify for. Because principal payments are deferred, lenders often prefer borrowers with a high credit score or high down payment. In addition, to compensate for the flexibility of the principal obligation and increased risk for the lender, lenders usually charge higher interest rates for balloon debt compared to other types of loans. What Is a Balloon Payment?
A balloon payment is a lump sum principal balance that is due at the end of a loan term. The borrower pays much smaller monthly payments until the balloon payment is due. These payments may be entirely or almost entirely interest on the loan rather than principal.
Borrowers are assuming that they can refinance the mortgage or sell the home at a profit before the balloon payment falls due. If the housing market takes an unexpected downturn and their home loses value, that strategy may fail.

*   The structure is strategically advantageous for some borrowers, such as people who flip houses, allowing them to secure lower upfront monthly payments and preserve future cash flow for other purposes (Advantages of Balloon Payments).","That's a great question! Balloon loans, while carrying some risks, do offer several attractive advantages, especially for certain borrowers or situations. According to the article, here are the main benefits:

*   **Lower Initial Monthly Payments:** This is often the biggest draw. The monthly payments during the initial period of a balloon loan are generally much lower than what you'd pay on a traditional, fully amortized loan. This can make the loan more affordable in the short term.
*   **Aligns with Income Expectations:** For some, the structure of a balloon loan can match their anticipated income growth. As their career progresses and salary increases, the larger debt obligation (the balloon payment) comes due, ideally when they are better positioned financially to handle it.
*   **Faster Underwriting Process & Lower Fees:** Balloon notes or loans often have a shorter approval process compared to other types of loans. This can translate to lower administrative or transaction fees. Sometimes, they even require less documentation, and for mortgages, may not even require a home appraisal, speeding up the closing.
*   **Strategic Advantage for Specific Situations:** These loans can be very useful for individuals or businesses with a clear strategy. For instance, house flippers can use balloon loans to secure lower upfront payments, giving them time to remodel and sell the house before the large payment is due.
*   **Preserves Future Cash Flow:** By keeping initial payments low, borrowers can free up cash flow for other important purposes, whether it's for business investments, other personal expenses, or simply maintaining more liquidity.

Essentially, balloon loans provide flexibility with upfront costs and can be a strategic tool for those who anticipate future financial improvement or have a plan to address the large final payment."

PHYSICAL THERAPY PROTOCOL AFTER LATARJET PROCEDURE:
The intent of this protocol is to provide the clinician with a guideline of the postoperative
rehabilitation course of a patient that has undergone an open Latarjet procedure. It is no means
intended to be a substitute for one’s clinical decision making regarding the progression of a
patient’s post-operative course based on their physical exam/findings, individual progress, and/or
the presence of postoperative complications. If a clinician requires assistance in the progression
of a postoperative patient, they should consult with the referring Surgeon.
Depending on the intraoperatively determined bone quality of the bone block, the surgeon
defines in the operative report when pendulum exercises, passive range of motion (PROM),
active range of motion (AROM) may be started. Accordingly, the postoperative protocol is
defined individually for each patient by the surgeon and recorded in the operation report.

What are some exercises for initial strengthening during latarjet recovery?","During the initial phase of Latarjet recovery (Week 1-4), some exercises for initial strengthening include:
*   Scapular clock exercises progressed to scapular isometric exercises (Page 2).
*   Ball squeezes (Page 2).
*   Continue Elbow, wrist, and finger AROM / resisted (Page 3).
*   Active and manual scapula strengthening exercises, such as shoulder shrug and roll (Page 3).

The dedicated ""strengthening phase"" (Week 9-12) includes exercises like:
*   Active Range of Motion External Rotation with Band Strengthening (Page 5).
*   Active Range of Motion Internal Rotation with Band Strengthening (Page 5).
*   Row with Resistance Band (Page 5).","The initial strengthening exercises during Latarjet recovery typically begin around **Week 9-12**, which is designated as the ""Strengthening Phase"" in the rehabilitation protocol. At this point, the goal is to gradually restore shoulder strength, power, and endurance, often using elastic bands and light weights (no heavier than 5 lbs).

It's crucial to remember that the surgeon will define when strengthening can begin based on factors like bone quality, and this will be noted in your operative report. Always consult with your surgeon and physical therapist before starting any new exercises.

Here are some of the exercises commonly initiated during this initial strengthening phase:

*   **Active Range of Motion External Rotation with Band Strengthening:** Using a resistance band to strengthen the muscles that rotate your arm outward.
*   **Active Range of Motion Internal Rotation with Band Strengthening:** Using a resistance band to strengthen the muscles that rotate your arm inward.
*   **Row with Resistance Band:** This helps strengthen your back and shoulder blade muscles.
*   **Towel/Hand-assisted Internal Rotation Stretch:** A gentle stretch to improve internal rotation.
*   **Side lying Internal Rotation Stretch at 70 and 90 Degrees:** Another stretch for internal rotation, performed while lying on your side.
*   **Cross-Body Stretch:** This helps stretch the posterior capsule of the shoulder.
*   **Water (pool) therapy:**
    *   **Standing in water with float under arm, lower body into water to help stretch into flexion:** The buoyancy of the water can assist with gentle forward movement.
    *   **Standing in water with float under arm, lower body to side to help with external rotation:** Using water resistance and buoyancy to assist with external rotation.

Remember, throughout this phase, it's important to continue to maintain full passive and active range of motion while gradually building strength. Avoid heavy lifting, sudden movements, or activities that could place excessive stress on the healing shoulder. Your physical therapist will guide you through these exercises and ensure proper form and progression."

HB 2281
Initials EB Page 1 Natural Resources, Energy & Water
ARIZONA HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Fifty-sixth Legislature
Second Regular Session
HB 2281: solar royalties fund; county residents
Sponsor: Representative Biasiucci, LD 30
Committee on Natural Resources, Energy & Water
Overview
Requires each county Board of Supervisors (BOS) to establish a County Resident Solar 
Royalties Fund (Fund).
History
Counties are required to adopt the standards for issuing permits for the use of certain solar 
energy devices. Various specifications must be met depending on if the solar energy device is 
used for: 1) construction with solar photovoltaic systems that are intended to connect to a 
utility system; or 2) solar water heating systems (A.R.S. § 11-323).
Provisions
1. Requires the BOS of each county to establish a Fund to be administered by the county 
treasurer. (Sec. 1)
2. States that the Fund will be funded by each owner or operator of a solar panel in that 
county whose solar panel:
a) is located in the relevant county; and
b) is not:
i. owned by a public service corporation that is regulated by the Arizona Corporation 
Commission (ACC) or by a public power entity that has service territory in 
Arizona; and
ii. subject wholly to an exclusive power purchase agreement with either a public 
service corporation regulated by the ACC or a public power entity that has service
territory in Arizona. (Sec. 1)
3. Requires the private owner or operator of a solar panel not owned by a public service 
corporation to pay the county where the solar panel is located 12.5% of every $1 that is 
received in revenues from the sale of kilowatt-hours from the solar panel. (Sec. 1)
4. Specifies these monies must be deposited in the Fund. (Sec. 1)
5. Requires the county treasurer to: 
a) determine the total amount of monies in the Fund and the total number of qualified 
individuals who live in the county;
b) use monies in the Fund for administrative costs that do not exceed 10% of the monies 
in the Fund;
c) pay, by check, each qualified resident of the county an equal distribution of the total 
amount of monies available in the Fund, after administrative costs are paid. (Sec. 1)
☐ Prop 105 (45 votes) ☐ Prop 108 (40 votes) ☐ Emergency (40 votes) ☐ Fiscal Note
HB 2281
Initials EB Page 2 Natural Resources, Energy & Water
6. States that the requirements of the Fund do not apply to solar panels that:
a) produce power for only on-site use by a commercial or industrial user;
b) does not export power to the grid; or
c) is a rooftop solar power system, regardless of whether the system exports power to the 
grid. (Sec. 1)

USER REQUEST:
Does this apply to me if I have ground-mounted solar panels in a field at my house that I use to sell back extra energy to the grid?","Yes, HB 2281 would apply to you if you are a private owner operating ground-mounted solar panels at your house and receive revenues from selling extra energy back to the grid (Sec. 1).

The requirements of the Fund apply to owners or operators of solar panels that are not owned by a public service corporation or public power entity, and are not wholly subject to an exclusive power purchase agreement with such an entity (Sec. 1). Private owners or operators are required to pay the county 12.5% of every $1 received in revenues from the sale of kilowatt-hours from the solar panel (Sec. 1).

The requirements of the Fund do not apply to solar panels that:
*   Produce power for only on-site use by a commercial or industrial user (Sec. 1). Your system sells power to the grid.
*   Do not export power to the grid (Sec. 1). Your system exports power to the grid.
*   Are a rooftop solar power system, regardless of whether the system exports power to the grid (Sec. 1). Your system is ground-mounted.

Since your situation does not fall under these exceptions and you are a private owner selling power to the grid, HB 2281 would apply (Sec. 1).","Based on the details of HB 2281, it looks like this bill **would apply to you** if it becomes law.

Here's why:

1.  **Who pays into the fund?** The bill states that the fund will be funded by owners or operators of solar panels in the county, specifically those that are not owned by public service corporations or public power entities and are not subject to a wholly exclusive power purchase agreement with them. Since you have panels at your house, you are a private owner.
2.  **What kind of revenue?** It requires private owners to pay 12.5% of revenues from the sale of kilowatt-hours from the solar panel. Since you sell extra energy back to the grid, you are generating revenue from selling kilowatt-hours.
3.  **Key exclusions and why they don't apply to you:** The bill lists certain types of solar panels that are *exempt* from these requirements, but your situation doesn't fit those exemptions:
    *   **On-site use by commercial/industrial users only:** Your panels are at your house, not primarily for a commercial or industrial user, and you *do* export power.
    *   **Does not export power to the grid:** You specifically mentioned that you *do* sell extra energy back to the grid.
    *   **Rooftop solar power system:** Your panels are *ground-mounted*, not rooftop.

Because your ground-mounted system exports power to the grid and is privately owned, it falls within the scope of what HB 2281 aims to regulate and collect royalties from, if enacted.

Essentially, the bill is designed to collect a percentage of the revenue generated by certain privately owned, non-rooftop, grid-exporting solar systems, with the collected funds then distributed equally to qualified residents of that county."

House-passed H.R. 8070 H.R. 8070, known as the Servicemember Quality of Life Improvement and National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2025, would authorize $883.7 billion, as requested, according to the accompanying committee report, H.Rept. 118-529. Together with amounts for certain defense-related programs not within the legislation’s purview or requiring additional authorization, the discretionary budget authority implication of the bill would total $895.2 billion—consistent with the defense discretionary spending cap for FY2025 established in the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 (P.L. 118-5). During an April 30, 2024, hearing on the FY2025 DOD budget request, Representative Mike Rogers, chair of the House Armed Services Committee (HASC), described the department’s request as inadequate to restore deterrence. “But this is the hand dealt to us by the Fiscal Responsibility Act that we all have responsibility for enacting,” he said. “As we move to mark up the FY2025 NDAA, we will play that hand that was dealt to us.” In preparation for House consideration of the legislation, Representative Barbara Lee submitted an amendment that would have reduced the amount authorized by the bill by $100 billion, excluding accounts related to the Defense Health Program, military personnel, and pay and benefits. The amendment was not considered for floor debate. A bipartisan amendment adopted as Section 1005 of the bill would reduce funding for a military department or defense agency by 0.5% upon failure to submit financial statements or achieve an independent audit opinion. While the overall level of funding authorizations in H.R. 8070 would match the President’s request, amounts authorized for certain types of accounts would differ from the request. For example, in terms of DOD titles, the legislation would authorize $3.8 billion (2.1%) more than requested for military personnel (MILPERS) appropriations, largely to support a 19.5% pay raise for certain junior enlisted service members and an expanded housing allowance benefit as part of a package of “quality of life” initiatives. The legislation would authorize $2.8 billion (1.7%) less than requested for procurement Congressional Research Service 3 appropriations, including the Shipbuilding and Conversion, Navy account—with no funding authorized for the Navy to procure the seventh Constellation-class (FFG) frigate, a type of small surface combatant. In a Statement of Administration Policy on H.R. 8070, the Biden Administration “strongly” opposed changing the basic pay schedule before the completion of the Fourteenth Quadrennial Review of Military Compensation (QRMC) and expressed disappointment at the level of shipbuilding funding, among other areas of disagreement. SASC-reported S. 4638 S. 4638 would authorize $908.4 billion, $25.1 billion more than requested for DOD to “accelerate equipment recapitalization, increase military construction, address the highest-priority unfunded requirements of the military services and combatant commanders, decrease the Department’s facility maintenance backlog, and strengthen the defense industrial base.” During debate of the bill in a closed session, the Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC) voted 16-9 on a motion “to include a provision that would increase the topline by $25.0 billion.” Senator Roger Wicker, Ranking Member of SASC, filed the motion following the release of a plan calling for a “generational investment” in the U.S. military—with proposed funding increases of $55 billion in FY2025 and additional amounts to reach 5% of Gross Domestic Product in the future—to prevent conflict, recapitalize U.S. military equipment, and safeguard national security innovation. Senator Jack Reed, chair of SASC, said he voted against reporting the bill to the Senate because it included “a funding increase that cannot be appropriated without breaking lawful spending caps and causing unintended harm to our military. I appreciate the need for greater defense spending to ensure our national security, but I cannot support this approach.” S. 4638 would authorize $25.1 billion more funding than requested for DOD, across each appropriation title, with $10.0 billion more than requested for procurement accounts; $2.9 billion more for research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT&E) accounts; and $3.1 billion more for military construction (MILCON) accounts. 

USER REQUEST:
What motivated congress to approve two competing bills?",The provided document does not contain this information.,"It's quite common for the House and Senate to develop their own versions of major legislation like the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), and these differences often stem from varying priorities, assessments of national security needs, and approaches to fiscal responsibility. In this case, the two competing bills, H.R. 8070 (from the House) and S. 4638 (from the Senate Armed Services Committee), reflect a fascinating tension in Congress.

Here's a breakdown of the motivations:

**Motivations for H.R. 8070 (House-passed Servicemember Quality of Life Improvement and National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2025):**

1.  **Adherence to Budget Caps:** A primary driver for the House bill was the **Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023**, which established discretionary spending caps for FY2025. H.R. 8070 authorizes a total discretionary budget authority of $895.2 billion, which is explicitly ""consistent with the defense discretionary spending cap.""
2.  **Focus on Servicemember Quality of Life:** As its name suggests, a significant motivation was to directly improve the lives of military personnel. This included authorizing **$3.8 billion more than requested for military personnel appropriations**, specifically to support a **19.5% pay raise for certain junior enlisted service members** and an **expanded housing allowance benefit**.
3.  **Working Within Constraints:** Representative Mike Rogers, chair of the House Armed Services Committee, acknowledged that the department's budget request might be ""inadequate to restore deterrence,"" but recognized that this was ""the hand dealt to us by the Fiscal Responsibility Act that we all have responsibility for enacting."" This shows a motivation to make the best possible decisions within the legally mandated budget limits, even if they wished for more.
4.  **Fiscal Accountability:** The adoption of a bipartisan amendment to reduce funding by 0.5% for agencies failing to submit financial statements or achieve an independent audit opinion indicates a motivation to improve financial oversight and accountability within the Department of Defense.

**Motivations for S. 4638 (SASC-reported bill):**

1.  **Greater Investment in National Security:** The Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC) was motivated by a desire to make a significantly larger investment in the U.S. military. The bill would authorize **$25.1 billion more than requested for DOD**, reflecting a belief that current funding levels are insufficient.
2.  **Addressing Unfunded Priorities and Modernization:** The increased funding is specifically aimed at critical areas such as:
    *   ""Accelerat[ing] equipment recapitalization""
    *   ""Increas[ing] military construction""
    *   ""Address[ing] the highest-priority unfunded requirements of the military services and combatant commanders""
    *   ""Decreas[ing] the Department’s facility maintenance backlog""
    *   ""Strengthen[ing] the defense industrial base""
3.  **""Generational Investment"" Vision:** Senator Roger Wicker, Ranking Member of SASC, explicitly championed this increase, calling for a ""generational investment"" to reach 5% of Gross Domestic Product in the future. His motivation was to ""prevent conflict, recapitalize U.S. military equipment, and safeguard national security innovation."" This indicates a long-term strategic vision for a stronger military.
4.  **Pushing Beyond Budget Caps:** Unlike the House, the Senate committee was willing to challenge or outright exceed the spending caps set by the Fiscal Responsibility Act, believing that national security imperatives trumped strict adherence to those caps. While Senator Jack Reed (SASC chair) voted against the bill for this very reason (breaking lawful spending caps), the majority of the committee clearly prioritized the increased defense spending.

**Why They Are ""Competing"":**

These bills are competing because they represent fundamentally different philosophies on how to fund national defense in the current fiscal and geopolitical climate:

*   **H.R. 8070** prioritizes fiscal discipline and direct improvements to servicemember well-being *within established budget limits*, even if it means making tough choices elsewhere (like reducing procurement for shipbuilding).
*   **S. 4638** prioritizes a robust, expanded defense posture and comprehensive military modernization, even if it means *exceeding current budget caps*.

Ultimately, these two approaches will need to be reconciled through negotiations between the House and Senate to produce a single, final NDAA that authorizes funding for the Department of Defense."

THE MINISTRY
The Ministry of Finance includes the Department of Finance, Alberta Capital Finance
Authority, Alberta Pensions Administration Corporation, ATB Financial, Alberta Insurance
Council, Credit Union Deposit Guarantee Corporation and their subsidiaries. The Ministry
of Finance also includes the activities of a number of companies in wind-up.
The Department of Finance has four main areas: Office of Budget and Management;
Pensions, Insurance and Financial Institutions; Treasury Management; and Corporate
Support.
The Finance Business Plan incorporates all the entities reporting to the Minister into an
integrated strategic plan that focuses on the key priorities for the Ministry. The following
plan does not include the day-to-day activities of the Ministry.
BUSINESS PLAN 2004-07
208 FINANCE BUSINESS PLAN 2004-07
VISION
A province that is innovative and globally competitive with a fiscally sustainable and accountable government.
LINK TO THE GOVERNMENT STRATEGIC BUSINESS PLAN
This plan supports the 3-Year Government of Alberta (GOA) Business Plan to have a prosperous economy (Goal 7), which
is aligned with the 20-Year Government of Alberta Strategic Business Plan of competing in a global marketplace
(Opportunity 3). The Finance plan provides support by keeping taxes competitive and the regulatory system effective.
The plan also supports the 3-Year GOA Business Plan of having a financially stable, open and accountable government
(Goal 8). This is aligned with the 20-Year Strategic Plan of making Alberta the best place to live, work and visit
(Opportunity 4). Support is provided through the ministry's efforts to smooth out fluctuations in resource revenue,
eliminate debt on schedule, keep spending affordable, ensure future sustainability of revenue to meet needs, monitor
performance and assist with capital planning and financing for infrastructure.
Finally, the Ministry Plan supports the 3-Year GOA Business Plan to have an effective, responsive and well-managed local
government (Goal 6), which is aligned with the 20-Year Strategic Plan to make Alberta the best place to live, work and
visit (Opportunity 4). The ministry provides support through the Alberta Capital Finance Authority.
SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES
Maintaining a strong and sustainable financial position poses challenges. Changing world economic conditions, exchange
rates and energy prices impact Alberta's economy and fiscal plan. The decline of high royalty rate conventional energy
revenues is an issue that is being addressed. Disasters and emergencies, such as BSE and severe weather conditions, are
unpredictable events that can have budget consequences. Volatile capital markets can affect pension plans and endowment
funds like the Alberta Heritage Savings Trust Fund, especially if markets are weak for extended periods. The Sustainability
Fund will help manage risks from energy and other revenues, as well as disasters and emergencies. An aging population
and early retirements will also impact pension plans. Recognizing pressures on pension plans will enable stakeholders to
work together to review pension plan governance and establish stabilizing strategies.
MISSION
Develop and
implement the
government's fiscal
framework and
financial policies.
CORE BUSINESSES
Core Business 1: Fiscal Planning and Financial Management
Goal 1 - A financially strong, sustainable and accountable government
Goal 2 - A fair and competitive provincial tax system
Goal 3 - Effective management of financial assets, liabilities and risk
Core Business 2: Regulation of Provincial Financial Institutions
Goal 4 - Reliable and competitive financial and insurance products and services
Core Business 3: Pensions Policy, Regulation and Administration
Goal 5 - Pensions that deliver on promises
Core Business 4: Financial Services
Goal 6 - Quality and competitive financial services accessible to Albertans and local
authorities
209FINANCE BUSINESS PLAN 2004-07
The government's new fiscal framework is designed to provide predictability, sustainability
and continued discipline to prepare Alberta for the challenges that lie ahead, while
maintaining a competitive tax environment. Finance will work with other ministries to
maintain a balanced approach in fiscal planning. In addition, Finance will implement the
accepted Financial Management Commission (FMC) recommendations, including the risk
analysis, three-year capital plans, alternative mechanisms for capital project financing,
capitalization and amortization of assets, and continued refinements to the government
reporting entity.
Public-private partnerships (P3s) have been identified as one option to deliver capital
projects, where appropriate. Finance provides financial expertise to other ministries on
financing government and government-funded capital projects, ranging from construction
to information technology. Finance also determines the appropriate accounting treatment
and the impact on the Province's financial position and fiscal plan. Finance will assess the
costs and risks of alternate financing vehicles, including P3s, and make recommendations
to mitigate provincial financial risk and achieve optimal value for money.
The Alberta government faces risks from a variety of sources. The concept of enterprise
risk management is to identify the sources of risk to all major components of the
Province's revenues and expenses and to use the collective strength of the enterprise to
manage those risks with a comprehensive cost-effective strategy. In cooperation with
other departments, Finance will develop an enterprise risk management framework and
provide recommendations for government consideration.
The Government is committed to ensuring Albertans have access to affordable automobile
insurance. Finance will work to implement recommendations from the government's
review of automobile insurance, including issues respecting automobile injury claims and
related premium increases.
Finance, in consultation with public sector boards and stakeholders, will review current
governance arrangements for public pension plans (in the context of recent proposals for
independence) with the objective of making recommendations to improve accountability to
plan members and taxpayers.

1 A financially strong, sustainable and accountable government
Maintaining Alberta's strong financial position means keeping the budget balanced and sustainable.
Strategic fiscal planning and prudent economic forecasting are required to meet today's priorities and
sustain essential programs and services over the longer term. The Alberta Sustainability Fund has been
established to cushion ongoing operating spending plans from volatile energy revenues and the costs of
emergencies and disasters. The new Fiscal Framework includes a three-year capital plan, with some
funding of capital from the capital account and alternative financing arrangements. The government
will continue to balance the budget every year in accordance with the fiscal framework and to reduce the
province's existing debt as scheduled. The government will also continue to fulfill its legislated
commitment to be accountable to Albertans by publishing three-year consolidated fiscal plans, quarterly
fiscal updates and annual performance reports, including audited financial statements, as required by the
Government Accountability Act.
In executing its leadership role for these initiatives, Finance will continue to assess the economic impact
associated with issues of concern to Albertans, including the implementation of the Climate Change
Strategy. The department will also take an active role in strategic corporate approaches to information
technology investment, governance and accountability.

2 A fair and competitive provincial tax system
Government policy is a low rate, broad base policy approach to promote efficiency of the tax system.
Taxes are necessary to provide the revenue that government needs to fund programs and services. The
tax system must be fair and promote self-reliance. Our taxes must also be competitive with those in
other provinces and countries with which Alberta competes, in order to attract the investment, jobs and
skilled workers necessary to keep our economy performing well. Alberta has a low single rate income
tax, the lowest tax on gasoline in the country and no general payroll tax. Alberta is the only province
without a capital tax or a general retail sales tax.
Finance continues to work with the federal government, other provinces and territories to promote
effective tax systems and collection arrangements.
GOAL TWO
What it means
Strategies
• Effective investment policies are in place to ensure optimal return.
• Develop an enterprise-wide risk management framework for government decisions.
• Invest the Sustainability Fund in high quality fixed income assets.
3 Effective management of financial assets, liabilities and risk
Finance through the Treasury Management Division has responsibility for the province's ongoing cash
management including short-term borrowing and investing, management of banking arrangements and
cash forecasting as well as arranging short and long-term financing for the government and provincial
corporations. Through prudent management of liabilities and assets, the Ministry endeavors to minimize
financing costs and maximize investment returns.
The Ministry has assumed a leadership role in developing an enterprise risk management framework so
that the Alberta Government can effectively manage the day-to-day financial challenges.

• Work with industry and consumer stakeholders to review the statutory provisions of the Insurance
Act respecting insurance contracts.
• Ensure a supervisory framework is in place to govern Alberta Treasury Branches (ATB Financial)
and that it is appropriate and comparable to that for private sector financial institutions.
4 Reliable and competitive financial and insurance products
and services
Financial service providers are responsible for ensuring that Albertans receive the services they have
purchased. Finance regulates the credit union, insurance, loan and trust industries in Alberta, in the
interests of depositors, insurance policy holders, insurance intermediaries, trust beneficiaries and the
companies themselves.
Finance is working with the automobile insurance industry to implement recommendations from the
government's review of automobile insurance, including issues respecting automobile injury claims and
related premium increases. In addition, Finance will monitor issues that face the insurance industry and
consumers with respect to general property and liability insurance in Alberta.

Pension plan members need to be assured that their benefits are secure. Employers and other plan
sponsors need to know that pension regulation is fair and even-handed. Finance assesses private sector
pension plan compliance with legislative standards and ensures that action is taken and 'at risk ' plans
comply with regulations. Finance will also continue to monitor funding of private sector pension plans.
The Department provides advice to the Minister of Finance on the financial soundness and governance
of the public pension plans. Alberta Pensions Administration Corporation (APA) provides
administrative services.
Finance works with the federal government and the other provinces to maintain the sustainability of the
Canada Pension Plan and explores alternatives to allow Albertans to secure their retirement income.
The Department provides support and information for government initiatives on public pension issues.
In addition, Finance works with stakeholders and other jurisdictions across Canada to harmonize and
streamline private pension legislation and regulatory processes.

Summarize the STRATEGIC Financial PRIORITIES 2004-07 for Alberta.","The strategic priorities for 2004-07 are:
*   Maintaining Alberta's Fiscal Framework (209)
*   Public-Private Partnerships (P3s) (209)
*   Enterprise-Wide Risk Management (209)
*   Automobile Insurance (209)
*   Public Pension Plans Governance (209)","Based on the 2004-07 Finance Business Plan for Alberta, the strategic financial priorities were focused on ensuring the province's fiscal health, managing its financial institutions and obligations, and promoting a competitive economic environment.

Here's a summary of Alberta's strategic financial priorities for 2004-07:

1.  **Maintaining Alberta's Fiscal Framework:**
    *   **What it means:** This was about keeping Alberta financially strong, sustainable, and accountable. The government aimed for a balanced budget, using strategic planning and economic forecasting to sustain essential programs. A key initiative was the **Alberta Sustainability Fund**, designed to buffer the province from volatile energy revenues and the costs of emergencies.
    *   **Key Actions:** Continuing to repay accumulated debt according to a legislated plan, implementing recommendations from the Financial Management Commission (especially regarding capital planning and government reporting), and providing transparent financial information to Albertans. The goal was to maintain Alberta's AAA credit rating.

2.  **Public-Private Partnerships (P3s):**
    *   **What it means:** The Ministry of Finance saw P3s as a potential option for delivering capital projects. They aimed to provide financial expertise to other ministries on how to finance government and government-funded projects, ranging from construction to IT.
    *   **Key Actions:** Assessing the financial costs and risks of proposed P3s and other alternative financing vehicles. The objective was to minimize provincial financial risk and ensure the government achieved the best value for its money.

3.  **Enterprise-Wide Risk Management:**
    *   **What it means:** Recognizing that the Alberta government faced risks from various sources (economic conditions, energy prices, disasters), this priority focused on a holistic approach to risk.
    *   **Key Actions:** Developing a comprehensive framework to identify risks across all major components of provincial revenues and expenses. The goal was to manage these risks in a cost-effective way, leveraging the collective strength of the government.

4.  **Automobile Insurance:**
    *   **What it means:** The government was committed to ensuring Albertans had access to affordable automobile insurance.
    *   **Key Actions:** Implementing recommendations from a government review of automobile insurance, specifically addressing issues related to automobile injury claims and the resulting premium increases. They also planned to work with industry and consumer stakeholders to review the relevant sections of the Insurance Act.

5.  **Public Pension Plans Governance:**
    *   **What it means:** This priority addressed the long-term security and accountability of public pension plans in Alberta. It recognized the importance of ensuring plan members received their promised benefits while also being accountable to taxpayers.
    *   **Key Actions:** Consulting with public pension boards and stakeholders to improve pension governance frameworks, including reviewing funding requirements for public plans and investment rules for private plans. This was in the context of proposals for greater independence for these plans.

In essence, these priorities collectively aimed to solidify Alberta's financial standing, promote responsible fiscal management, and ensure key financial services and obligations met the needs of its citizens and local authorities in a sustainable and accountable manner."
"DOCUMENT:
Although the world of cryptocurrency is steadily expanding and gaining popularity, traditional banks are hesitant to adopt the use of these digital assets—believing that their inherent risks outweigh their potential benefits. However, regulatory agencies such as the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) are working to change banks’ perception of digital currencies, believing that these assets could positively drive financial institutions to a new era of innovation and efficiency.
 

 Recently, the OCC issued several interpretive letters detailing how traditional financial institutions can enter into transactions (or develop services) involving digital currencies. This effort coincides with the OCC’s hope that additional regulatory guidance will help banks become more comfortable with these digital assets. In early January, the OCC announced that national banks and federal savings associations can now use public blockchains and stablecoins to perform payment activities. This opens the door for banks to have the ability to process payments much quicker and without the need of a third-party agency. Essentially, this clarifying letter puts blockchain networks in the same category as SWIFT, ACH, and FedWire, paving the way for these networks to be part of the larger banking ecosystem.
 

 Banks may be wary of cryptocurrency, thinking that transactions involving these assets present heightened risk and require lengthy and expensive due diligence. But digital currencies can offer many benefits to financial institutions and their customers, they just need to take the leap.
 

 Why Banks are Cautious of Cryptocurrencies
 According to a study conducted by the Association of Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialists (ACAMS) and the U.K.’s Royal United Services Institute, nearly 63% of respondents who work in the banking industry perceive cryptocurrency as a risk rather than an opportunity.
 

 Decentralized Nature
 Crypto assets were created as an alternative to traditional banking infrastructure that don’t need an intermediary and aren’t tethered to the capacity of a centralized government, bank, or agency. Instead of relying on centralized intermediaries in these transactions, the trust is placed in the blockchain code and the distributed nature of the blockchain.
 

 A cryptocurrency that’s managed by a central bank diminishes the appeal of the asset in the first place, so some banks don’t believe that they’ll be able to enter this space successfully. The decentralized nature of the currency is seen to undermine the authority of central banks, leaving some to believe that they won’t be needed anymore, or they’ll be unable to control the money supply.
 

 AML/KYC Concerns
 Cryptocurrencies allow for peer-to-peer transactions without a regulated intermediary, giving the user the ability to easily transfer funds quickly without having to pay transaction fees. Instead of identifying the transaction by an individual bank account through a financial institution, transactions are simply linked to the transaction ID on the blockchain.
 

 This type of pseudonymity worries many banks who are concerned about the lack of anti-money laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC) regulations surrounding digital currency transactions. Oftentimes, banks are under the impression that cryptocurrency transactions can’t be tracked for AML and KYC considerations, which could lead to illegal activity and scams on the network.
 

 Volatility
 The price of cryptocurrencies (bitcoin specifically) have generally been volatile over their short life. There are many reasons for this including market size, liquidity, and the number of market participants. Banks see this as a risk because historically, the price hasn’t been stable, so they believe the currency might not remain a stable investment vehicle over time.
 

 How Banks Can Get Involved in the Cryptocurrency Industry
 To avoid being left behind, banks need to find a way to embrace this technology and treat it as a friend rather than an enemy. Cryptocurrency adoption could streamline, enhance, and upgrade financial services, and there are plenty of recent industry advancements that can ease banks’ concerns around the risks and instead let them recognize the potential benefits.
 

 Custody Services
 In July, the OCC stated that banks and savings associations could provide crypto custody services for customers, including holding unique cryptographic keys associated with accessing private wallets. This means that the OCC believes that banks could safely and effectively hold either the cryptocurrency itself, or the key to access crypto on a personal digital wallet for its customers.
 

 Easy Onboarding & Expert Assistance
 Banks could help bring new, less experienced individual investors into the space by developing tools that would facilitate the adoption of crypto by their customers. For example, inexperienced cryptocurrency investors may not have the capabilities to set up their own wallet to custody their own cryptocurrency. Rather than leaving their cryptocurrency “off exchange” or at an unregulated third party, they may find it easier and more secure to hold it within a trusted financial institution.
 

 Banks could offer interest-bearing crypto accounts, where customers could invest the crypto on the back end or through other financial tools. Banks might relieve some of the stress of investors that aren’t experts in the nuances of crypto by acting as a trusted third party that’s well-respected in the finance industry and can keep investors’ assets protected.
 

 AML/KYC Regulations Administered
 In 2019, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network’s (FinCEN) determined that any cryptocurrency transactions and custody services conducted through crypto entities that are considered money service businesses must still abide by AML/KYC regulations. This will help avoid malicious transactions, illegal activity, or scams using these platforms. These regulations could help banks and larger financial institutions conduct due diligence on customers involved in crypto transactions, further diminishing their anxieties about the risks that these transactions pose.
 

 There’s even a possibility that blockchain technology could automate AML and KYC verifications. Blockchain could potentially allow for a streamlined view of shared data on individuals between banks, loan officers, and other institutions. In other words, there could eventually be one blockchain that stores all customer data. This blockchain data could then be utilized by all financial institutions, allowing for fast reviews of customers to quickly identify any red flags insinuating nefarious or illegal activity.
 

 Security Concerns
 Banks can help mitigate the security concerns of cryptocurrency holders. Hacking of personal wallets and exchanges is a concern for many holders. Well-established banks could help secure digital currencies from theft or hacks, putting clients’ minds at ease. Bringing cryptocurrency under bank supervision could help diminish criminal activity or the appearance to outsiders that cryptocurrency transactions aren’t secure.
 

 Payments
 As indicated in the most recent OCC letter, banks can utilize public blockchains, including stablecoins, to speed up their payment processes. Blockchain technology provides a faster and less expensive alternative to clearing houses when processing transactions. The clearing and settlements could occur at a much faster rate if banks utilized blockchain technology.
 

 Smart Contracts
 When entering into an agreement through a smart contract, there’s a reduced level of trust needed among parties because the success of the transaction relies on computer code instead of an individual’s behavior. Banks could reinforce that trust by becoming a reliable third party that utilizes these smart contracts for mortgages, commercial loans, letters of credit, or other transactions.
 

 Guidance and regulation surrounding digital assets is sparse, leaving many financial institutions wary of adoption. Concerns surrounding the security and stability of cryptocurrency also hold banks back from entering this space—but instead of fearing the risks of this technology, banks should be looking ahead to its potential benefits.
 

 Financial institutions should also shift from thinking of crypto as a competitor to that of a partner. Banks can actually play a significant role in the crypto industry, adding some much needed assurance and security to the largely unregulated environment. Adopting cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology overall can streamline processes and take banking into the next generation of efficiency and innovation.

Your desire for your local bank to be intertwined with crypto for a sense of security is a very common and understandable sentiment, and it's actually where the future of banking seems to be headed.

Historically, banks have been a bit wary of cryptocurrencies. They often saw them as risky due to their decentralized nature, concerns about money laundering (AML) and knowing their customers (KYC), and price volatility. In fact, studies show a significant percentage of banking professionals view crypto more as a risk than an opportunity. They were also worried about the idea of digital assets undermining their authority or ability to control the money supply.

However, things are rapidly changing, and regulatory bodies like the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) are actively working to bridge this gap. They believe that digital assets can truly drive financial institutions into a new era of innovation and efficiency, and they're issuing guidance to help banks feel more comfortable.

Here’s how cryptocurrencies are likely to change the future of banks, especially in a way that could bring you that sense of security you're looking for:

### How Your Bank and Crypto Could Become Intertwined:

1.  **Your Bank as a Trusted Custodian:**
    *   Imagine your bank offering a service to hold your cryptocurrency, much like they hold your cash or traditional investments. The OCC has already stated that banks can provide ""crypto custody services."" This means they could securely hold the actual digital currency for you or, even more commonly, hold the unique cryptographic keys that give you access to your digital wallet.
    *   **What this means for you:** Instead of worrying about managing your own digital wallet, which can be daunting for newcomers, or trusting an unregulated third-party exchange, your bank could become the secure and regulated guardian of your digital assets. This directly addresses your security concerns!

2.  **Simplified Onboarding and Expert Guidance:**
    *   Cryptocurrency can be complex to navigate, especially for less experienced investors. Your bank could step in as a trusted expert, developing user-friendly tools to help you buy, sell, and manage crypto directly through their existing platforms.
    *   **What this means for you:** You wouldn't need to figure out how to set up wallets or understand complex transactions on your own. Your bank could make it as easy as opening a savings account or buying a stock, offering peace of mind and professional support. They might even offer interest-bearing crypto accounts, allowing you to earn on your digital holdings.

3.  **Enhanced Security Against Scams and Hacks:**
    *   One of the big fears around crypto is the risk of hacking personal wallets or unregulated exchanges. Banks, with their robust security infrastructure and decades of experience protecting customer assets, are uniquely positioned to mitigate these risks.
    *   **What this means for you:** Bringing cryptocurrency under bank supervision could significantly diminish the threat of criminal activity and make your crypto holdings much more secure, similar to how your regular bank accounts are protected.

4.  **Addressing Regulatory Concerns (AML/KYC):**
    *   A major hurdle for banks has been the perceived lack of anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) regulations in the crypto space. However, FinCEN (Financial Crimes Enforcement Network) has clarified that crypto entities offering services like custody must abide by these same regulations.
    *   **What this means for you:** Banks will apply their existing rigorous AML/KYC checks to crypto transactions, which helps prevent illegal activities and scams. There's even potential for blockchain technology itself to automate these verifications, creating a more transparent and secure environment for everyone involved.

5.  **Faster and Cheaper Payments:**
    *   The OCC has given the green light for national banks to use public blockchains and stablecoins (cryptocurrencies pegged to a stable asset like the US dollar) for payment activities. Blockchain technology can process transactions much faster and at a lower cost than traditional systems like SWIFT or ACH, as it eliminates the need for multiple intermediaries.
    *   **What this means for you:** While not directly about owning crypto, this fundamental integration means your everyday banking transactions could become significantly quicker and more efficient in the future. Imagine near-instant international transfers!

6.  **Innovative Services like Smart Contracts:**
    *   Banks could leverage ""smart contracts,"" which are self-executing agreements coded onto a blockchain. These contracts reduce the need for trust between parties because the terms are automatically enforced by the code.
    *   **What this means for you:** In the future, your bank could use smart contracts to make processes like mortgages, commercial loans, or other financial agreements more secure, transparent, and automated, reducing paperwork and potential disputes.

In essence, the future of banks isn't about being replaced by cryptocurrency, but rather about **integrating and becoming a crucial bridge** between the traditional financial world and the digital asset space. Your bank could evolve from a cautious observer into a trusted partner, offering you the security and regulatory oversight that has been missing in the largely unregulated crypto environment.

So, while you might not be able to walk into your local branch and ask for ""some Bitcoin"" today in the same way you deposit cash, the regulatory groundwork and technological advancements are rapidly paving the way for that future. Your desire for security through your bank's involvement is exactly what many regulators and forward-thinking financial institutions are working towards. It's an exciting time for finance, and your bank is likely to play a significant role in making crypto more accessible and safer for everyone."

**What's publicly known about ""Switch 2""**

Nintendo, notoriously secretive, has so far said nothing — or almost nothing — on the record about its next game console. As Nintendo Switch approaches its seventh birthday in March 2024, questions about how much longer it will last are natural: Seven years is a typical lifespan for a console generation, Switch sales are falling fast, and the technology powering the console is showing its age. But Nintendo has flatly refused to engage with those questions.

Behind the scenes, however, Nintendo is gearing up for the release of its new machine, briefing its partners, and releasing development kits. Information has started to leak, and a picture of what form the console will take has begun to emerge, as well as when we can expect to hear about it and when we can expect to buy one.

It’s no surprise that Nintendo is treading carefully. The Switch has been an enormous success — it’s the third-best-selling console of all time, behind only PlayStation 2 and Nintendo’s own DS handheld — which presents both a big opportunity and a big risk. Historically, Nintendo has struggled to follow its most popular formats: Wii and DS were followed by the flop of Wii U and the relative disappointment (in sales terms) of 3DS. Nintendo’s usual insistence on hardware innovation has proven as likely to alienate its audience as to find a new one. Will Nintendo break with its own tradition and follow the Switch with a more powerful take on the same formula, or will it try something different?

Nintendo is targeting a March 2025 release for the successor to Switch, according to a Nikkei report (as spotted and translated by VGC) on Feb. 26. Nikkei corroborates earlier reporting by the specialist press that the console’s release had slipped out of its original late 2024 window.

Nikkei has a few new details to add. First is that firm March window, as opposed to “early 2025” — indicating that Nintendo, as expected, still hopes to release Switch 2 in its next financial year. Secondly, Nintendo’s reason for the delay is not just ensuring a strong software lineup, but trying to build up enough inventory of the console itself to avoid the shortages and widespread reselling by scalpers that blighted the PlayStation 5’s launch.

Thirdly and most ominously, Nikkei says that Switch 2’s release could slip beyond March if the software isn’t ready and if Nintendo hasn’t manufactured enough units.

Elsewhere, Nikkei corroborates earlier reports that Switch 2 will be a hybrid portable device like Switch, and that it will feature a larger screen than the current model.

Regarding its name, the answer is that we don’t know. It’s worth noting that Nintendo has never before named its consoles in numerical sequence, even when they were direct follow-ups to a previous generation, such as the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Game Boy Advance, and Nintendo 3DS. Super Nintendo Switch (or Super Switch!) has a certain ring to it, if you ask us. But for now, “Switch 2” is a serviceable shorthand, and what we’ll use in this article.

The answer here appears to be yes. Recent reporting by VGC, citing multiple sources after dev kits arrived at partner studios, said that the console “would be able to be used in portable mode, similar to the Nintendo Switch.” This was later corroborated by Nikkei.

There’s no word yet on whether the console will feature detachable Joy-Con controllers like the Switch, or whether it will have a handheld-only variant like the Switch Lite. But early signs are that Nintendo is keen to follow closely in the footsteps of the 130-million-plus-selling Switch.

It might be a bit bigger, though. A 2024 report from a Japanese analyst suggests the console will have an 8-inch screen, compared to the original Switch’s 6.2 inches and the Switch OLED model’s 7 inches.

Nintendo hasn’t officially indicated when the Switch 2 will be released, but we have a few clues.

Originally, multiple sources reported that the console was planned to debut in the second half of 2024. However, it now appears that Nintendo is targeting a March 2025 release date.

Brazilian games journalist Pedro Henrique Lutti Lippe originally broke the news of the slip to 2025, saying that multiple sources said they were working on games that are set to launch alongside the Switch 2. Both Eurogamer and VGC heard similar claims from their sources. Nikkei then reported Nintendo was targeting March 2025 in an effort to avoid hardware shortages and ensure a strong lineup of games — but noted a slip beyond March was still possible.

While this is later than we previously expected, it fits in with an October 2023 interview with Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa, who reiterated that the company would remain focused on Switch until the end of Nintendo’s current fiscal year in March 2024, and added that it would continue to support Switch with new titles in the following fiscal year. The shift from “focus” to “support” for the Switch implies that a new console will launch in Nintendo’s next fiscal year — so, between April 2024 and March 2025.

This also lines up with what we know about declining Switch sales, the stage Nintendo is at in the development of the console, and the release schedule for Switch games. Nintendo previously ruled out releasing a new console before the end of March 2024, and it now has Switch games scheduled through summer 2024; the latest release on the current schedule is Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD, which has been given a summer 2024 slot. (It’s also worth noting that the recently announced remake of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door doesn’t have a more precise release date than “2024.”)

This does mean the Switch 2 will miss the 2024 holiday season, but it’ll give the company more time to stockpile some first-party titles, according to VGC sources.

This is the big question, with many users hoping — or outright expecting — to carry forward their game libraries to Nintendo’s next console, as has become the norm with the latest generations of Xbox and PlayStation consoles. The answer remains unknown, and it’s not easy to predict, either.

VGC’s report said that the backward compatibility of the machine “remains unclear.” Some third-party publishers were said to be worried about the potential impact on sales of next-gen titles if the machine is backward-compatible. For its part, Nintendo has (in a rare on-the-record comment) said it hopes to bring Switch users over to the new platform with their Nintendo accounts; if the Nintendo account system persists, that would in theory make it easy for users to access previous purchases. But that’s not the same thing as the console being technically capable of it.

Nintendo has a decent, if not flawless, record for supporting backward compatibility. Wii played GameCube games, and Wii U played Wii games; Game Boy Advance was backward-compatible with Game Boy, and 3DS with DS. But the Switch, with its new game cartridge format, enforced a clean break with the past, and Nintendo has made a mint from rereleasing Wii U games on the machine, particularly the 55-million-selling Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.

On balance, as long as the machine uses the same format for physical releases (see below), Nintendo’s record suggests that it will make the Switch 2 backward-compatible. However, there remain technical hurdles to implementing backward compatibility, and much will depend on the chip architecture Nintendo has chosen for the Switch 2, which is not currently known.

Of all the console manufacturers, Nintendo’s ties to the retail industry are perhaps the strongest — stronger even than Sony’s — so Nintendo is extremely unlikely to go digital-only for the Switch 2, even if this would seem to make sense for a portable machine.

Indeed, VGC’s report included the detail that the new console will have a cartridge slot for physical releases. This is as close to a dead cert as we can get with the Switch 2 — and it also happens to support the machine having the same or similar form factor as the Switch, as well as increasing the likelihood of backward compatibility.

Thanks to Microsoft’s legal battles over its acquisition of Activision Blizzard, and reports of demos given by Nintendo to partners at Gamescom, we are beginning to get a sense of how capable the Switch 2’s hardware will be.

Internal emails released as part of the FTC v. Microsoft case revealed that Activision executives met with Nintendo in December 2022 to discuss the console, and came away with the impression that performance would be close to “Gen8 platforms” — in other words, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. (Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick later said that he had not seen tech specs for the machine, however.)

If anything, the “Gen8” comparison sounds as though it might undersell the Switch 2’s capabilities. According to Eurogamer’s and VGC’s reporting on the behind-closed-doors Gamescom demos, Nintendo showed hardware targeting the specs of the console running The Matrix Awakens’ Unreal Engine 5 tech demo with ray tracing enabled and “visuals comparable to Sony’s and Microsoft’s current-gen consoles.”

This doesn’t mean that the Switch 2 will be as powerful as PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. Instead, Nintendo is likely using clever techniques to reduce the demand on a less powerful graphics processor. VGC reported that the demo ran using Nvidia’s advanced DLSS upscaling technology, which uses AI to upscale the resolution of the image.

Still, the mention of Unreal Engine 5 — which is establishing itself as the industry standard engine, targeting current console hardware — along with DLSS and ray tracing suggests that Nintendo is keen to get closer to PS5 and Xbox Series X in terms of performance, and perhaps make it more feasible for developers to port their home console releases on the Switch 2. Reporting by Reuters and Digital Foundry suggests the console will use a custom Nvidia chip that will be capable of both ray-tracing and DLSS.

Also at Gamescom, a special, improved version of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild was shown, running at higher resolution and frame rate than it does on Switch.

The Switch 2 will feature one tech downgrade, however: Reportedly, the console will feature an LCD screen, unlike the OLED screen seen in the current top-of-the-range Switch model, as a cost-cutting measure.

How Telescopes Are Like Eyes
Telescopes and eyes are both tools for collecting and detecting light. In fact,
telescopes can be thought of as bigger, more powerful eyes. Eyes have an opening
called the pupil where the light enters; a lens to focus the light; and a retina in the
back to detect the light. Telescopes also have an opening to let in light; a lens or
mirror to focus the light; and a detector to receive and process the light.
In the eye, chemical reactions in the retina convert light into electrical signals, w h i c h
are processed by the brain. In telescopes, several different kinds of light detectors are
used. Some telescopes contain electronic devices that convert light into electrical
signals that can be analyzed and stored by a computer. In other telescopes, the light
is focused onto photographic film, where the information is recorded as a photograph.
In simple backyard telescopes, the light is focused onto the eye of the person looking
through the telescope. In this case, the telescope’s light detector is a human eye.
When you look through a telescope, all of the light that enters eventually reaches the
back of your eye. Hundreds of times more light enters a small telescope than would
n o rmally enter your eye because the telescope’s opening (also known as its “apert u r e ” )
is much bigger than your pupil. The telescope’s lens or mirror focuses all of this light
so that it fits through your pupil. This is why telescopes let you see objects that do
not give off enough light to see by unaided eye alone. 
Telescopes have several advantages over eyes, including larger light-collecting areas;
collecting light for longer periods of time; and the ability to detect wavelengths of
light invisible to humans.
Larger Light-Collecting Areas
When you move from a bright area into darkness, the pupil in your eye can expand
from less than 1/1 6 inch to more than o inch in diameter — becoming sixteen times
greater in area —in order to take in more light. Telescopes offer a way to expand
the light-collecting area even further, in effect increasing the size of your pupil by
hundreds or thousands of times. A simple backyard telescope with a 4-inch-diameter
lens can capture 250 times more light than an eye with a o -inch-wide pupil, and
the Hubble Space Telescope’s 94.5-inch mirror captures 143,000 times as much light
as a o -inch pupil.
Telescopes that capture radio waves look nothing like optical telescopes, but the
surface area of the collector still determines how powerful the telescope is. Radio
telescopes collect light in “dishes” that resemble satellite TV antennas. The wider
the dish, the more powerful the telescope, because a wider dish can capture more
light. The radio telescope at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico has a dish
1,000 feet wide
Collecting Light for Longer Periods of Time
The light detectors in telescopes can gather light from a single source over a long
period of time. In some cases, light collected over several hours is used to create a
single image. This is something the human eye cannot do. The cells in your retina
collect light for just a fraction of a second. Then they repeat the process, essentially
taking a new picture about twenty times a second. This enables your eye to keep
track of moving objects. If your eye did not constantly update its information about
where things are, moving objects would become a blur.
When collecting light from faint objects such as distant galaxies, however, a
twentieth of a second is not enough time for your eye to see anything at all, even if
you are looking through a large telescope. Astronomers solve this problem by
attaching special detectors to telescopes. This lets them point a telescope at a single
object for minutes or even hours and combine all the light the camera receives into a
single image. The resulting image reveals much more than a person could see with
their eyes, even looking through the same telescope.
In the past, telescope detectors used photographic film. Though some still use film,
most research telescopes now use electronic cameras that store digital images
on a computer.
The electronic light detectors used in telescopes are called charged-coupled devices,
or CCDs. CCD chips are made of thousands of tiny sensors that convert light into
an electrical signal. The amount of electricity that passes through a given spot on the
chip reveals how much light struck that point. Computers process the electrical
information to make a digital image. The same technology is used in photocopiers,
fax machines, video cameras, and bar code readers, all of which convert light signals
into electrical signals.
The Ability to Detect Wavelengths of Light Invisible to Humans
Many telescopes are built to detect wavelengths of light your eyes cannot. Light
from space comes in many wavelengths, most of which are invisible to the human
eye—including gamma rays, X rays, ultraviolet and infrared light, microwaves,
and radio waves. Whether visible or invisible, all light contains information about
its source. So astronomers use special telescopes to detect wavelengths of light
not visible to humans.
The hotter an object is, the shorter the wavelengths of light it gives off. Because stars
are so hot, much of the light they emit is in wavelengths too short for your eyes to
see. Pictures of the Sun taken in ultraviolet or X-ray light, for instance, show hot,
glowing jets of gas arching out of the Sun. These shapes are always there, but they
cannot be seen in visible wavelengths.
Telescopes sensitive to different wavelengths of light are useful in observing
different astronomical phenomena.
Gamma Ray Telescopes
Gamma rays have the shortest wavelength and contain the most energy of any form
of light. They are believed to come from highly energetic processes such as collisions
between two black holes, collisions between two neutron stars, or the collapse of
hyperstars—giant stars even bigger than the ones that cause supernovas.
The design of a gamma-ray telescope is unique in that the telescope itself is one big
detector without any lenses or mirrors. The wavelengths of gamma rays are so small
that they pass easily through conventional lenses or mirrors.
X-ray Telescopes
X-ray telescopes are used to observe extremely hot sources, such as the gases around
black holes. X-ray telescopes cannot focus X-ray light the same way that ordinary
telescopes do, because X-rays go right through most mirrors. Some X ray telescopes
have special mirrors shaped like long, narrow tubes. As X rays enter the tube, they
graze the mirror just enough to reflect gently toward a detector instead of passing
through the mirror. 
Ultraviolet Telescopes
Ultraviolet (UV) light has shorter wavelengths than visible light. These waves
come from very hot stars. Ultraviolet telescopes can also be used to observe the hot
gases surrounding the Sun. UV telescopes appear very similar in design to visible
light telescopes except they are equipped with specially designed detectors sensitive
to UV light.
Visible Light Telescopes
Optical telescopes capture the same kind of light your eyes can see. They reveal how
distant objects would look if we were closer to them. Most of the cosmic images we
see in magazines and newspapers come from visible light telescopes. Visible light is
also a good source of information about average-temperature stars like the Sun.
Infrared Telescopes
Infrared light has fairly long wavelengths that pass through clouds of dust better
than light with shorter wavelengths. Infrared telescopes are used to observe objects
surrounded by dust, such as young stars being born inside nebulae. Because all
warm objects give off infrared light, infrared telescopes are chilled so that they
won’t detect their own glow. The lifespan of an infrared telescope is limited by how
long the telescope can be kept cool. 
Microwave Telescopes
Microwaves are used to observe the afterglow of the Big Bang, the ancient explosion
that created the Universe. Microwave radiation also reveals the presence of many
small molecules, such as carbon monoxide. The design of microwave telescopes is
most similar to that of radio telescopes: large metallic “dishes” that collect and focus
the longer wavelengths of microwave light.
Radio Telescopes
Radio waves have long wavelengths, from a meter on up to over a kilometer.
Extremely large telescope dishes are required to capture these long wavelengths.
Radio telescopes can reveal details of distant galaxies and nebulae. Radio telescopes
helped astronomers discover “pulsars,” which are collapsed stars that rotate rapidly,
emitting pulses of radio waves like the rotating lights on a police car or a lighthouse.

Explain the differences between gamma ray and infrared telescopes.","Gamma ray telescopes and infrared telescopes differ in the wavelengths of light they detect, the astronomical phenomena they observe, and their design and operation.

Gamma ray telescopes detect gamma rays, which have the shortest wavelength and most energy of any form of light, and are believed to come from highly energetic processes like collisions between two black holes or neutron stars, or the collapse of hyperstars (""Gamma Ray Telescopes""). Their design is unique because the telescope itself is one big detector without any lenses or mirrors, as gamma ray wavelengths are so small they pass easily through conventional lenses or mirrors (""Gamma Ray Telescopes"").

Infrared telescopes detect infrared light, which has fairly long wavelengths that pass through clouds of dust better than shorter wavelengths (""Infrared Telescopes""). They are used to observe objects surrounded by dust, such as young stars being born inside nebulae (""Infrared Telescopes""). Since all warm objects give off infrared light, infrared telescopes are chilled to prevent them from detecting their own glow, and their lifespan is limited by how long they can be kept cool (""Infrared Telescopes"").","That's a great question! While both gamma ray and infrared telescopes are designed to observe light invisible to the human eye, they are incredibly different in what they detect, how they're built, and what astronomical phenomena they help us study.

Here's a breakdown of the key differences:

1.  **The Type of Light They Detect:**
    *   **Gamma Ray Telescopes:** These telescopes detect **gamma rays**, which have the **shortest wavelengths** and the **most energy** of any form of light. They are at the extreme energetic end of the electromagnetic spectrum.
    *   **Infrared Telescopes:** These telescopes detect **infrared light**, which has **fairly long wavelengths** compared to visible light, making it less energetic than visible light but more energetic than microwaves or radio waves. It's often associated with heat.

2.  **What They Observe (Sources and Phenomena):**
    *   **Gamma Ray Telescopes:** They are used to observe incredibly energetic and violent processes in the universe, such as:
        *   Collisions between black holes.
        *   Collisions between neutron stars.
        *   The collapse of hyperstars (stars even bigger than those causing supernovas).
        *   Essentially, anything that produces extreme amounts of energy.
    *   **Infrared Telescopes:** They are ideal for observing:
        *   **Objects surrounded by dust**, like young stars being born inside nebulae, because infrared light can pass through dust clouds better than shorter wavelengths (like visible light).
        *   **All warm objects**, as they naturally emit infrared light. This allows astronomers to study cooler objects or regions that don't emit much visible light.

3.  **Their Design and How They Work:**
    *   **Gamma Ray Telescopes:** Their design is quite unique. Gamma rays have such tiny wavelengths that they would simply pass right through conventional lenses or mirrors. Therefore, a gamma-ray telescope is essentially **one big detector** without any traditional optical components like lenses or mirrors to focus the light.
    *   **Infrared Telescopes:** These telescopes have a critical design feature: they **must be chilled** to extremely low temperatures. This is because all warm objects (including the telescope itself!) give off infrared light. To accurately detect the faint infrared signals from space, the telescope needs to be much colder than its surroundings to prevent it from detecting its own ""glow."" This cooling system also limits the operational lifespan of infrared telescopes.

In essence, gamma ray telescopes peer into the most violent corners of the universe, detecting light from events with unimaginable energy, using a design that bypasses conventional optics. Infrared telescopes, on the other hand, are designed to see through cosmic dust and detect the heat emitted by objects, requiring significant cooling to achieve their observations."

LIFE INSURANCE AND CRITICAL ILLNESS COVER POLICY SUMMARY. This policy is provided by Legal & General Assurance Society Limited. OVERVIEW. These policies are designed for people who want to help protect against the impact of death or terminal illness or critical illness. The policy could be used to help pay your outstanding mortgage or to help protect your family’s lifestyle and everyday living expenses. This Policy Summary is only a brief guide to the cover and exclusions. You will find full details in the Policy Booklet which will form the basis of our contract with you. WHAT IS COVERED? Life insurance You will be covered if before the end of the policy: • you die. • you are diagnosed as being terminally ill, and in the opinion of your hospital consultant and our medical officer, the illness is expected to lead to death within 12 months. We’ll pay out your amount of cover once. After this happens, the policy will end and you’ll no longer have any cover. Critical illness cover If you choose to add critical illness cover alongside your life insurance as a separate policy, (also referred to as additional or independent critical illness cover) you will be covered if before the end of the policy: • You are diagnosed with or undergo a medical procedure for one of the critical illnesses we cover and you survive for 14 days from diagnosis. We’ll pay out your amount of cover in full once. After this happens, the policy will end and you’ll no longer have any cover. T 2 LIFE INSURANCE AND CRITICAL ILLNESS COVER XWHAT IS NOT COVERED? You are not covered if you don’t give us full and honest answers to the questions we ask you before the policy starts. Please don’t assume that we’ll contact your doctor to find out your full medical details. Life insurance We won’t pay out: • If within the first year of the policy, your death is caused by suicide or, intentional and serious self-injury or an event where, in our reasonable opinion, you took your own life. • If some elements of cover are restricted based on the information you give us. If we do this we’ll tell you what we’ve excluded in your policy booklet under ‘What you are not covered for’. • The amount of cover more than once if a joint life policy is chosen. This may be when the first person dies or has a valid claim. We have a replacement cover option which could allow the other person covered to take out a new single life policy, ensuring they still have some protection in place. • If you are diagnosed with a terminal illness which doesn’t meet our definition. Terminal Illness cover can’t be claimed: • after your death • or if the length of the policy is less than two years. Critical illness cover We won’t pay out: • If you are diagnosed with or undergo a medical procedure for one of the critical illnesses we cover which doesn’t meet our definition. • If death occurs within 14 days of diagnosis of one of the critical illnesses we cover. • If you die. • If some elements of cover are restricted based on the information you give us. If we do this we’ll tell you what we’ve excluded in your policy booklet under ‘What you are not covered for’. • The amount of cover more than once if a joint life policy is chosen. This will be when the first person has a valid claim. We have a replacement cover option which could allow the other person covered to take out a new single life policy, ensuring they still have some protection in place. For all policies • Life cover policies have no cash value and we will not pay out if you reach the end of the policy without making a valid claim. • If you stop paying your premiums your cover will end 60 days after the first missed premium. 3 LIFE INSURANCE AND CRITICAL ILLNESS COVER ABOUT THE POLICY. YOUR PREMIUMS Your premiums will remain the same during the length of the policy unless you make any changes. AGE LIMITS Product Maximum age for buying a policy Minimum length of the policy Maximum length of the policy Your policy must end before age Life Insurance* 77 1 year 50 years 90 Decreasing Life Insurance* 74 5 years 50 years 90 Critical Illness Cover* 67 2 years 50 years 75 The minimum age to take out a policy is 18. The policy must not end before your 29th birthday. *Guaranteed premiums 4 LIFE INSURANCE AND CRITICAL ILLNESS COVER YOUR COVER Level cover If you choose level cover, your amount of cover will stay the same unless you change it. If the policy is to help repay a mortgage, you need to ensure that your amount of cover matches your outstanding mortgage. The policy may not completely pay off your outstanding mortgage, if you change the mortgage you have in any way and you don’t adjust your cover to match your new arrangements. Decreasing cover If you choose decreasing cover it is often used to help protect a repayment mortgage. Therefore the amount of cover reduces roughly in line with the way a repayment mortgage decreases. You need to ensure that your amount of cover matches your outstanding mortgage. The policy may not completely pay off your outstanding mortgage, if: • you change the mortgage you have in any way and you don’t adjust your cover to match your new arrangements. • the interest rate on your mortgage becomes higher than the rate applied to the policy. The rate will be shown in your Personal Quote or the Policy Booklet. 5 LIFE INSURANCE AND CRITICAL ILLNESS COVER BENEFITS FOR LIFE INSURANCE.

ATLANTA, Feb. 14, 2023 – The Coca-Cola Company today reported strong fourth quarter and full-year 2022 results. “While 2022 brought many challenges, we are proud of our overall results in a dynamic operating environment,” said James Quincey, Chairman and CEO of The Coca-Cola Company. “As we begin 2023, we continue to invest in our capabilities and strengthen alignment with our bottling partners to maintain flexibility. We are keeping consumers at the center of our innovation and marketing investments, while also leveraging our expertise in revenue growth management and execution. Our growth culture is leading to new approaches, more experimentation, and improved agility to drive growth and value for our stakeholders.” Highlights Quarterly / Full-Year Performance • Revenues: For the quarter, net revenues were strong, growing 7% to $10.1 billion. Organic revenues (non-GAAP) grew 15%. Organic revenue (non-GAAP) performance was strong across operating segments and included 12% growth in price/mix and 2% growth in concentrate sales. The quarter included one additional day, which resulted in a 1-point tailwind to revenue growth. The quarter also benefited from the timing of concentrate shipments. For the full year, net revenues grew 11% to $43.0 billion, and organic revenues (non-GAAP) grew 16%. This performance was driven by 11% growth in price/mix and 5% growth in concentrate sales. • Operating margin: For the quarter, operating margin, which included items impacting comparability, was 20.5% versus 17.7% in the prior year, while comparable operating margin (non-GAAP) was 22.7% versus 22.1% in the 1 prior year. For the full year, operating margin, which included items impacting comparability, was 25.4% versus 26.7% in the prior year, while comparable operating margin (non-GAAP) was 28.7% in both the current year and the prior year. For both the quarter and the full year, operating margin benefited from strong topline growth but was unfavorably impacted by the BODYARMOR acquisition, higher operating costs, an increase in marketing investments versus the prior year, currency headwinds and items impacting comparability. • Earnings per share: For the quarter, EPS declined 16% to $0.47, and comparable EPS (non-GAAP) was even at $0.45. EPS performance included the impact of a 12-point currency headwind, while comparable EPS (non-GAAP) performance included the impact of an 11-point currency headwind. For the full year, EPS declined 3% to $2.19, and comparable EPS (non-GAAP) grew 7% to $2.48. EPS performance included the impact of an 11-point currency headwind, while comparable EPS (non-GAAP) performance included the impact of a 10-point currency headwind. • Market share: For both the quarter and the full year, the company gained value share in total nonalcoholic readyto-drink (“NARTD”) beverages, which included share gains in both at-home and away-from-home channels. • Cash flow: Cash flow from operations was $11.0 billion for the full year, a decline of $1.6 billion versus the prior year, as strong business performance was more than offset by the deliberate buildup of inventory in the face of a volatile commodity environment, cycling working capital benefits from the prior year, and higher tax payments and annual incentive payments in 2022. Free cash flow (non-GAAP) was $9.5 billion, a decline of $1.7 billion versus the prior year. Company Updates • Evolving company leadership to fuel growth: The company continues to focus on having the right leaders and organizational structure to deliver on its growth strategy, while also developing talent for the future. Through recent leadership appointments, the company continued to optimize its organizational design, connecting functions endto-end while identifying key opportunities to drive meaningful growth over the long term. During the quarter, John Murphy began an expanded role as President and Chief Financial Officer, and added oversight of Global Ventures, Bottling Investments, Platform Services, customer and commercial leadership, and online-to-offline digital transformation. The company also named Henrique Braun to the newly created role of President, International Development to oversee seven of the company’s nine operating units. Braun will steward growth of the consumer base across developing and emerging markets as well as developed markets. Braun will partner with Nikos Koumettis, President of the Europe operating unit, and Jennifer Mann, President of the North America operating unit, on global operational strategy in order to scale best practices and help ensure the company captures growth opportunities across all of its markets.

I was reading this article about Coca-cola's earnings in Q4 2022, but I need a summary. Did the earnings per share performance have an impact on the data mentioned regarding cash flow? Please explain why or why not, and make it 300-350 words","The Coca-Cola Company reported strong fourth quarter 2022 results, with net revenues growing 7% to $10.1 billion and organic revenues (non-GAAP) increasing 15% (The Coca-Cola Company, ""Highlights Quarterly / Full-Year Performance - Revenues""). This organic revenue growth was driven by a 12% increase in price/mix and 2% growth in concentrate sales (The Coca-Cola Company, ""Highlights Quarterly / Full-Year Performance - Revenues""). The operating margin for the quarter was 20.5%, compared to 17.7% in the prior year, while comparable operating margin (non-GAAP) reached 22.7% (The Coca-Cola Company, ""Highlights Quarterly / Full-Year Performance - Operating margin""). Although benefiting from strong topline growth, the operating margin was unfavorably impacted by the BODYARMOR acquisition, higher operating costs, increased marketing investments, currency headwinds, and items affecting comparability (The Coca-Cola Company, ""Highlights Quarterly / Full-Year Performance - Operating margin""). Earnings per share (EPS) for the quarter declined 16% to $0.47, and comparable EPS (non-GAAP) remained even at $0.45, with both being impacted by significant currency headwinds (The Coca-Cola Company, ""Highlights Quarterly / Full-Year Performance - Earnings per share""). The company also successfully gained value share in the total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink (NARTD) beverages market, across both at-home and away-from-home channels (The Coca-Cola Company, ""Highlights Quarterly / Full-Year Performance - Market share"").

The provided document does not contain information explicitly linking the earnings per share (EPS) performance to the data mentioned regarding cash flow. The document discusses EPS and cash flow as distinct financial metrics, detailing the factors that influenced each independently. For the quarter, EPS declined 16% to $0.47, with comparable EPS (non-GAAP) at $0.45, both impacted by currency headwinds (The Coca-Cola Company, ""Highlights Quarterly / Full-Year Performance - Earnings per share""). Separately, the document states that cash flow from operations for the full year was $11.0 billion, a decline of $1.6 billion versus the prior year, and free cash flow (non-GAAP) was $9.5 billion, a decline of $1.7 billion (The Coca-Cola Company, ""Highlights Quarterly / Full-Year Performance - Cash flow""). The document attributes the decline in cash flow to strong business performance being offset by factors such as a deliberate buildup of inventory, cycling working capital benefits from the prior year, and higher tax payments and annual incentive payments in 2022 (The Coca-Cola Company, ""Highlights Quarterly / Full-Year Performance - Cash flow""). There is no statement within the provided text suggesting that the decline or performance of EPS directly influenced these cash flow figures or their contributing factors.","It sounds like you're diving into Coca-Cola's latest financial results, which can definitely be a lot to unpack! Let's break down their Q4 2022 performance and then address your question about earnings per share and cash flow.

**Summary of Coca-Cola's Q4 2022 Earnings:**

Coca-Cola reported a strong end to 2022 despite a dynamic operating environment. Net revenues for the fourth quarter grew 7% to $10.1 billion, with impressive organic revenue growth of 15%. This was largely driven by a 12% increase in price/mix and a 2% growth in concentrate sales, demonstrating their ability to increase pricing and sales volume. Their operating margin also improved to 20.5% (up from 17.7% in the prior year), though it faced headwinds from the BODYARMOR acquisition, higher operating costs, increased marketing investments, and currency fluctuations.

However, earnings per share (EPS) for the quarter saw a 16% decline to $0.47, with comparable EPS remaining flat at $0.45. Both were significantly impacted by currency headwinds. Despite these challenges, the company gained value share in the total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink (NARTD) beverage market and remains focused on strategic investments and evolving leadership to drive future growth. CEO James Quincey highlighted their commitment to innovation, consumer focus, and strengthening bottling partnerships.

**Did EPS Performance Impact Cash Flow Data?**

No, the earnings per share (EPS) performance itself did not directly impact the cash flow data. Here’s why:

EPS is a profitability metric, calculated from a company's net income (the ""bottom line"" on the income statement) divided by its outstanding shares. It's based on **accrual accounting**, which recognizes revenues when earned and expenses when incurred, regardless of when cash actually changes hands.

Cash flow, on the other hand, measures the actual cash generated or used by a company's operations. It accounts for the real movement of money in and out of the business. While a company's profitability (reflected in EPS) and its cash generation are generally related, they are distinct measures, and one doesn't directly ""impact"" the *data* of the other.

The document explicitly states the reasons for the decline in Coca-Cola's full-year cash flow from operations ($11.0 billion, a $1.6 billion decline). These reasons were:
*   A deliberate buildup of inventory due to a volatile commodity environment.
*   Cycling working capital benefits from the prior year.
*   Higher tax payments.
*   Increased annual incentive payments in 2022.

These factors are operational and represent actual cash movements, which are different from the non-cash expenses (like depreciation) or accruals that might influence net income and, consequently, EPS. Therefore, while both EPS and cash flow are crucial indicators of financial health, they measure different aspects and are influenced by different mechanisms, rather than one directly affecting the other's reported figures."

Question: [If GM partners with my insurance company, can they give them information about how much I am driving?]","GM collects ""mileage"" information about your vehicle (page 3). GM ""may share the information it collects about you, your vehicle, or your connected devices"" with ""companies we enter into business or marketing arrangements with, such as arrangements supporting services we offer to you"" (page 5). Therefore, if GM partners with your insurance company and that partnership falls under a business or marketing arrangement supporting services, they may share information about how much you are driving (mileage).","Based on the information provided, if GM partners with your insurance company, they **may** be able to share information about how much you are driving.

Here's why:

1.  **Types of Information Collected:** GM explicitly states they collect ""information about your vehicle,"" which includes details like:
    *   **Mileage**
    *   **Geolocation data**
    *   **Fuel history**
    *   **Battery charging and discharging history**
    *   **Oil/battery status**
    All of these data points can be used to determine or infer how much a vehicle is being driven.

2.  **Sharing with Partners:** The document states that GM ""may share the information it collects about you, your vehicle, or your connected devices... with companies we enter into business or marketing arrangements with, such as arrangements supporting services we offer to you."" If your insurance company is considered one of these business or marketing partners, then GM could share this vehicle usage data with them.

While the document doesn't explicitly say ""we will share your mileage with your insurance partner,"" it clearly outlines that GM collects data relevant to your driving habits and has provisions for sharing information with business partners. In many cases, these types of partnerships between auto manufacturers and insurance companies are set up for ""usage-based insurance"" programs, where drivers can opt-in to share their driving data for potential discounts.

It's always a good idea to review the specific terms of any program or service you enroll in, especially if it involves data sharing with third parties like insurance providers."

**About BRAF Mutations**
TESTING FOR BRAF MUTATIONS IN SOLID TUMORS CAN INFORM CRITICAL TREATMENT DECISIONS

BRAF V600 has been identified as a driver mutation across various solid tumors

BRAF mutations occur in about 8% of solid tumors, most commonly in melanoma and thyroid cancers

Indication

TAFINLAR, in combination with MEKINIST, is indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients 1 year of age and older with unresectable or metastatic solid tumors with BRAF V600E mutation who have progressed following prior treatment and have no satisfactory alternative treatment options.

This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on overall response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.  

Limitation of Use: TAFINLAR, in combination with MEKINIST, is not indicated for the treatment of patients with colorectal cancer because of known intrinsic resistance to BRAF inhibition. TAFINLAR is not indicated for the treatment of patients with wild-type BRAF solid tumors.

Important Safety Information

New Primary Malignancies

Cutaneous Malignancies

In the pooled adult safety population of TAFINLAR administered with MEKINIST (“the combination”), the incidence of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cuSCC, including keratoacanthomas) occurred in 2% of patients. Basal cell carcinoma and new primary melanoma occurred in 3% and <1% of patients, respectively.

In the pooled pediatric safety population of the combination, new primary melanoma occurred in <1% of patients.

Perform dermatologic evaluations prior to initiation of the combination, every 2 months while on therapy, and for up to 6 months following discontinuation.

Noncutaneous Malignancies

Based on its mechanism of action, TAFINLAR may promote the growth and development of malignancies with activation of monomeric G protein (RAS) through mutation or other mechanisms. In the pooled adult safety population of TAFINLAR monotherapy and the combination, noncutaneous malignancies occurred in 1% of patients.

Monitor patients receiving the combination for signs or symptoms of noncutaneous malignancies. Permanently discontinue TAFINLAR for RAS-mutation–positive noncutaneous malignancies. No dose modification is required for MEKINIST in patients who develop noncutaneous malignancies.

Tumor Promotion in BRAF Wild-type Tumors. In vitro experiments have demonstrated paradoxical activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling and increased cell proliferation in BRAF wild-type cells that are exposed to BRAF inhibitors. Confirm evidence of BRAF V600E or V600K mutation status prior to initiation of therapy.

Hemorrhage. Hemorrhage, including major hemorrhage defined as symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ, can occur with the combination. Fatal cases have been reported.

In the pooled adult safety population of the combination, hemorrhagic events occurred in 17% of patients; gastrointestinal hemorrhage occurred in 3% of patients; intracranial hemorrhage occurred in 0.6% of patients; fatal hemorrhage occurred in 0.5% of patients. The fatal events were cerebral hemorrhage and brainstem hemorrhage.

In the pooled pediatric safety population of the combination, hemorrhagic events occurred in 25% of patients; the most common type of bleeding was epistaxis (16%). Serious events of bleeding occurred in 3.6% of patients and included gastrointestinal hemorrhage (1.2%), cerebral hemorrhage (0.6%), uterine hemorrhage (0.6%), postprocedural hemorrhage (0.6%), and epistaxis (0.6%).

Permanently discontinue TAFINLAR for all grade 4 hemorrhagic events and for any grade 3 hemorrhagic events that do not improve. Withhold TAFINLAR for grade 3 hemorrhagic events; if improved, resume at the next lower dose level. Permanently discontinue MEKINIST for all grade 4 hemorrhagic events and for any grade 3 hemorrhagic events that do not improve. Withhold MEKINIST for grade 3 hemorrhagic events; if improved, resume at the next lower dose level.

Colitis and Gastrointestinal Perforation. Colitis and gastrointestinal perforation, including fatal outcomes, can occur. In the pooled adult safety population of MEKINIST administered with TAFINLAR, colitis occurred in <1% of patients and gastrointestinal perforation occurred in <1% of patients. In the pooled pediatric safety population of MEKINIST administered with TAFINLAR, colitis events occurred in <1% of patients. Monitor patients closely for colitis and gastrointestinal perforations.

Venous Thromboembolic Events. In the pooled adult safety population of MEKINIST administered with TAFINLAR, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) occurred in 2% of patients. In the pooled pediatric safety population of MEKINIST administered with TAFINLAR, embolism events occurred in <1% of patients.

Advise patients to immediately seek medical care if they develop symptoms of DVT or PE, such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or arm or leg swelling. Permanently discontinue MEKINIST for life-threatening PE. Withhold MEKINIST for uncomplicated DVT and PE for up to 3 weeks; if improved, MEKINIST may be resumed at a lower dose.

Cardiomyopathy. Cardiomyopathy, including cardiac failure, can occur. In the pooled adult safety population of the combination, cardiomyopathy, defined as a decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥10% from baseline and below the institutional lower limit of normal (LLN), occurred in 6% of patients. Development of cardiomyopathy resulted in dose interruption or discontinuation of TAFINLAR in 3% and <1% of patients, respectively, and in 3% and <1% of patients receiving MEKINIST, respectively. Cardiomyopathy resolved in 45 of 50 patients who received the combination. In the pooled pediatric safety population of the combination, cardiomyopathy, defined as a decrease in LVEF ≥10% from baseline and below the institutional LLN, occurred in 9% of patients.

Assess LVEF by echocardiogram or multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan before initiation of the combination, 1 month after initiation, and then at 2- to 3-month intervals while on treatment. Withhold TAFINLAR for symptomatic cardiomyopathy or asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction of >20% from baseline that is below institutional LLN. Resume TAFINLAR at the same dose level upon recovery of cardiac function to at least the institutional LLN for LVEF and absolute decrease ≤10% compared to baseline. For an asymptomatic absolute decrease in LVEF of 10% or greater from baseline that is below the LLN, withhold MEKINIST for up to 4 weeks. If improved to normal LVEF value, resume at a lower dose. If no improvement to normal LVEF value within 4 weeks, permanently discontinue MEKINIST. For symptomatic cardiomyopathy or an absolute decrease in LVEF of >20% from baseline that is below LLN, permanently discontinue MEKINIST.

Ocular Toxicities

Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO): There were no cases of RVO across clinical trials of the combination. RVO may lead to macular edema, decreased visual function, neovascularization, and glaucoma.

Urgently (within 24 hours) perform ophthalmologic evaluation for patient-reported loss of vision or other visual disturbances. Permanently discontinue MEKINIST in patients with documented RVO.

Retinal Pigment Epithelial Detachment (RPED): RPED can occur. Retinal detachments may be bilateral and multifocal, occurring in the central macular region of the retina or elsewhere in the retina. In clinical trials, routine monitoring of patients to detect asymptomatic RPED was not conducted; therefore, the true incidence of this finding is unknown. In the pooled pediatric safety population of MEKINIST administered with TAFINLAR, RPED events occurred in <1% of patients.

Perform ophthalmologic evaluation periodically, and at any time a patient reports visual disturbances. Withhold MEKINIST if RPED is diagnosed. If resolution of the RPED is documented on repeat ophthalmologic evaluation within 3 weeks, resume MEKINIST at the same or a reduced dose. If no improvement after 3 weeks, resume at a reduced dose or permanently discontinue MEKINIST.

Uveitis: In the pooled adult safety population of the combination, uveitis occurred in 2% of patients. In the pooled pediatric safety population of the combination, uveitis occurred in 1.2% of patients.

Treatment employed in clinical trials included steroid and mydriatic ophthalmic drops. Monitor patients for visual signs and symptoms of uveitis (eg, change in vision, photophobia, and eye pain). If iritis is diagnosed, administer ocular therapy and continue TAFINLAR without dose modification. If severe uveitis (ie, iridocyclitis) or if mild or moderate uveitis does not respond to ocular therapy, withhold TAFINLAR and treat as clinically indicated. Resume TAFINLAR at the same or lower dose if uveitis improves to grade 0 or 1. Permanently discontinue TAFINLAR for persistent grade 2 or greater uveitis of >6 weeks.

Chair Sanders, Senator Murray, Ranking Member Cassidy, Members of the Committee:
 My name is Mady Anderson, and I live in Houston, Texas.
 Two years ago, during my senior year at the University of Houston, I had just come out of a
 two-year relationship. After a couple weeks of nausea and not sleeping or eating, I took a
 pregnancy test.
 I called my friends to bring me more tests because I was in disbelief. At one point I had five
 positive tests in front of me.
 I was pregnant.
 This was just two weeks after Texas’s abortion ban, known as S.B. 8, went into effect, banning
 abortion after six weeks.
 I knew almost immediately that abortion was the right decision for me.
 I called and got an appointment for the following week at my local Planned Parenthood, five
 minutes away. I thought I was early enough to be able to get my abortion that week. But at my
 appointment my pregnancy measured at 11 weeks.
 I was shocked. I couldn’t get an abortion in Texas.
 I called 20 different clinics after that first visit.
 Yes, you heard correct. 20.
 I called surrounding states and even as far as the Dakotas; no one could see me right away.
 The earliest I could be seen was two weeks later, at Jackson Women's Health Organization in
 Mississippi.
 This was before the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health decision that would take away the
 federal constitutional right to abortion. Before 20 more states would ban abortion. Before wait
 times in states without bans grew longer and longer.My dad took off from work, and we drove a total of 720 miles roundtrip, and spent 13 hours on
 the road. We spent five hours in a hotel trying to sleep, before going to my first appointment —
 just to turn right around and head back home.
 And here’s the thing: Because of medically unnecessary restrictions on abortion care in
 Mississippi, I would have to make the trip all over again. The state, essentially, put patients in a
 time-out because they don’t trust people to know what is best for our own health and lives.
 When I got this news, I was angry, sleep-deprived, and starving — and as certain as I ever was
 that I wanted an abortion. That certainty never faltered.
 The following week my mom was able to find us affordable tickets, and we flew back to Jackson.
 We started our day at 7 a.m. for my 1:30 p.m. appointment. After my procedure, I waited in the
 recovery room for about 20 mins, before hopping in a car to make my flight back home.
 I want to talk for a moment about money. As a college student who took out multiple student
 loans, I was counting every penny.
 ● I had to pay for the appointment in Houston.
 ● Then gas and hotel for the first trip to Mississippi.
 ● Then the first appointment in Mississippi.
 ● Then plane tickets for the second trip to Mississippi.
 ● Then the abortion itself.
 ● Then I missed 20 hours of work.
 ● And 20 hours of my mandatory internship program.
 ● The total? $2,850.
 There is no dollar value I can put on the stress of managing all of this. The despair of having to
 go to such lengths for basic, safe health care that was legal just weeks before I needed it. The
 gut-wrenching reality of having to disclose this deeply personal thing that should be private to
 professors, my boss, and anyone else in a position of authority over me for fear of not only
 losing my job but also failing out of all my classes due to all the classes and assignments I
 missed.
 I felt so much anger that politicians in Austin thought they had the right to make this decision for
 me.
 I am one of thousands of people who have now gone through this. Every day, every month we
 go without a federal right to abortion, there will be more of us. More savings accounts drained,
 more classes and shifts missed, more choices about which bill to skip paying.
 If I had found out I was pregnant last year or last month, Jackson Women’s Health wouldn’thave been there for me. The people who cared for me that day cannot care for abortion patients
 in Mississippi. I would have had to go to New Mexico, Kansas, or as far as Illinois.
 When we talk about abortion, it’s easy to get stuck talking in theoreticals.
 But I am a real person.
 The lives of abortion patients are not theoretical. People will continue to get pregnant when we
 don’t want to be. We will always need abortions.
 There is simply no place for politicians to decide for us.
 Thank you for inviting me here today and letting me share my story.

Here's a summary of why she couldn't get an abortion in Texas and the struggles she endured to finally receive care:

Mady was unable to get an abortion in Texas because the state's abortion ban, known as S.B. 8, had just gone into effect, making abortions illegal after six weeks of pregnancy. Despite realizing she was pregnant only a couple of weeks after the law was enacted, her pregnancy was measured at 11 weeks during her initial appointment, placing her well beyond the legal limit in Texas.

To finally get an abortion, Mady went through an arduous and costly ordeal:

*   **Extensive Clinic Search:** After learning she couldn't get care in Texas, she called an astonishing **20 different clinics**. She reached out to facilities in surrounding states and even as far as the Dakotas, but couldn't secure an immediate appointment.
*   **First Trip to Mississippi:** The earliest she could be seen was two weeks later at Jackson Women's Health Organization in Mississippi. Her father had to take time off work, and they embarked on a 720-mile roundtrip drive, spending 13 hours on the road and five hours in a hotel, only to learn that Mississippi's ""medically unnecessary restrictions"" required her to return for a second appointment due to a mandatory waiting period.
*   **Emotional and Physical Toll:** This news left her feeling angry, sleep-deprived, and starving, compounding the stress of her situation. She emphasizes that her certainty about wanting an abortion never wavered despite these immense hurdles.
*   **Second Trip to Mississippi and Financial Strain:** The following week, her mother helped her find affordable plane tickets, and they flew back to Jackson. This trip involved starting their day at 7 a.m. for a 1:30 p.m. appointment, undergoing the procedure, and quickly catching a flight back home. As a college student taking out multiple loans, the financial burden was substantial, totaling **$2,850**. This cost included:
    *   The initial appointment in Houston.
    *   Gas and a hotel for the first trip to Mississippi.
    *   The first appointment in Mississippi.
    *   Plane tickets for the second trip to Mississippi.
    *   The abortion procedure itself.
    *   Loss of income from missing 20 hours of work.
    *   Loss of internship hours from missing 20 hours of her mandatory program.
*   **Academic and Professional Impact:** Beyond the direct costs, Mady faced immense stress from managing the logistics, feeling despair over the lengths she had to go to for basic healthcare, and having to disclose deeply personal information to professors and her boss. She feared losing her job or failing classes due to missed assignments and time away.

Mady's testimony powerfully illustrates the real-world consequences of abortion bans, highlighting how they drain financial resources, disrupt education and work, and force individuals to navigate complex, emotionally taxing, and often geographically distant journeys for essential healthcare. Her story is a poignant reminder that while politicians may debate theoreticals, the lives of those seeking abortion care are undeniably real and profoundly affected."

Recent State Laws Differ in Their Restrictions
State laws differ in their approaches and requirements. For example, some states enacted information-
gathering laws that mandate disclosure of, or require studies on, foreign ownership of U.S. land. Other
laws directly prohibit certain transactions and may require divestiture of foreign-owned land. Some
restrictions apply only to agricultural land; others to land near military installations, critical infrastructure,
or economically valuable sites; and others to all real property within the state.
State laws also vary as to which groups are subject to land ownership restrictions. Some seek to regulate
real property transactions with individuals and entities from a list of named countries. Others aim to
govern purchases by all non-U.S. citizens. Another set addresses purchases by individuals and entities
from countries identified on lists maintained under federal law, such as the International Traffic in Arms
Regulations (Tables 1 and 2 of 22 C.F.R. § 126); the foreign adversaries list generated under Executive
Order 13873 and its implementing regulations; sanctions lists maintained by the Office of Foreign Assets
Control (OFAC) in the Department of the Treasury; or countries of particular concern designated by the
U.S. Secretary of State.

SB 264 Creates Two Sets of Restrictions on Land Ownership in Florida
Florida’s law, SB 264 (codified at Florida Statutes §§ 692.201–.205), effective July 1, 2023, creates two
sets of land ownership restrictions. The first set applies to foreign principals connected with foreign
countries of concern (defined as China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, Cuba, the Venezuelan regime of Nicolás Maduro, and Syria). Foreign principals are defined as the foreign governments themselves,
certain corporate and political bodies, and individuals domiciled in the countries of concern who are not
U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents. Individuals and entities in these groups cannot acquire or own
agricultural land in Florida or real property within 10 miles of a military installation or critical
infrastructure facility in the state.
SB 264’s second set of restrictions applies only to certain individuals and entities connected with the
People’s Republic of China (PRC)—the PRC itself, certain political bodies and individual members of the
PRC or the Communist Party of China, companies organized under PRC law or that have their principal
place of business there, and individuals domiciled in the PRC who are not U.S. citizens or lawful
permanent residents. These PRC-connected individuals and entities cannot purchase any real property in
Florida, absent an exception.
Both sets of restrictions exempt de minimis investments in some securities or companies registered with
the Securities and Exchange Commission. Individuals with nontourist visas or who have been granted
asylum may also purchase one parcel up to 2 acres in size that is not within 5 miles of a military
installation. Preexisting land owners that acquired their property before SB 264 became effective can
continue to own their parcels, but they cannot buy additional land unless permitted by law. SB 264
requires all foreign principals—both existing owners and new purchasers—to register land ownership
with state officials if the parcel is within 10 miles of a military installation or critical infrastructure. Some
PRC-connected individuals and entities must register regardless of the parcel’s location.

    *   Preexisting land owners who acquired property before SB 264 became effective can continue to own their parcels, but cannot buy additional land unless permitted by law (Florida Statutes §§ 692.201–.205).
*   **Registration Requirements** (Florida Statutes §§ 692.201–.205):
    *   All foreign principals (existing owners and new purchasers) must register land ownership with state officials if the parcel is within 10 miles of a military installation or critical infrastructure (Florida Statutes §§ 692.201–.205).
    *   Some PRC-connected individuals and entities must register regardless of the parcel’s location (Florida Statutes §§ 692.201–.205).","Florida's SB 264, which became effective on July 1, 2023, sets up two main categories of restrictions on foreign ownership of land, along with specific exceptions and requirements:

*   **Restrictions for ""Foreign Countries of Concern"":**
    *   Applies to individuals and entities connected with **China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, Cuba, the Venezuelan regime of Nicolás Maduro, and Syria**. This includes their governments, certain corporations and political bodies, and individuals domiciled in these countries who are not U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents.
    *   These foreign principals **cannot acquire or own agricultural land** in Florida.
    *   They also **cannot acquire or own real property within 10 miles of a military installation or critical infrastructure facility** in the state.

*   **Broader Restrictions Specifically for Individuals and Entities from the People's Republic of China (PRC):**
    *   This set of rules is more restrictive and applies to the PRC government itself, certain political bodies and members of the PRC or the Communist Party of China, companies organized under PRC law or with their principal place of business there, and individuals domiciled in the PRC who are not U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents.
    *   These PRC-connected individuals and entities are **prohibited from purchasing any real property in Florida**, unless a specific exception applies.

*   **General Exemptions and Provisions:**
    *   **De Minimis Investments:** Both sets of restrictions exempt small investments in certain securities or companies registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
    *   **Visa/Asylum Holders:** Individuals holding non-tourist visas or those granted asylum *may* purchase one parcel of land, up to 2 acres in size, provided it is **not within 5 miles of a military installation**.
    *   **Preexisting Ownership:** Owners who acquired property before July 1, 2023, can continue to own their land, but are generally restricted from buying additional property unless permitted by the law.
    *   **Registration Requirements:**
        *   All foreign principals, whether existing owners or new purchasers, must register their land ownership with state officials if the property is located within 10 miles of a military installation or critical infrastructure.
        *   Some PRC-connected individuals and entities are required to register their land ownership regardless of the parcel's location.

In essence, Florida's law targets specific countries and entities, with a particularly broad prohibition on all real property purchases for those connected to the PRC, while also imposing registration duties for many foreign landowners."

Challenges and Considerations Promulgating the Final Rule
The CFPB took more than a decade before promulgating the final Section 1071 rule. Evaluating the extent of lending gaps—and specifically fair lending risks—in small business credit markets has complications. Dodd-Frank directed the definition of small business, discussed in the section of this report entitled “Summary of the Section 1071 Final Rule.” Nevertheless, the CFPB’s challenge was to design a dataset with the ability to conduct meaningful comparisons across loan products and over time given the various differences in small business types and models.

Section 1071: Small Business Lending Data Collection and Reporting
    Multiple Small Business Definitions
No consensus definition of small business exists among the federal government and industry participants. Consequently, establishing a universal dataset to evaluate the performance of small business lending markets is challenging. Definitions of small business include the following:
• The SBA defines small business primarily by using a size standards table it compiles and updates periodically. The table lists size thresholds for various industries by either average annual receipts or number of employees.10 The SBA also defines small business differently for different SBA programs. For example, the SBA’s 7(a), Certified Development Company/504, and Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) programs have alternative size standards based on tangible net worth and average net income.11
• Academic research frequently uses a firm that has 500 employees or fewer (but does not monopolize an industry) as a proxy measure for a small business. Various federal agencies—such as the U.S. Census Bureau, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the Federal Reserve—have relied upon this definition.12 In addition, some researchers view microbusinesses as a subset of small businesses. A common academic definition of microbusiness is a firm with only one owner, five employees or fewer, and annual sales and assets under $250,000.13
• Definitions of small business also vary in statute. For example, eligibility thresholds for “small business” tax incentives vary under tax law. Certain firms with average annual gross receipts of $25 million or less are able to use cash-based accounting for tax purposes. The tax credit for employee health insurance costs is available to employers with 25 or fewer employees whose average annual compensation is below a certain wage threshold.14
• According to a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation survey, small and large banks have their own definitions of small business.15 Small banks (defined as banks with $10 billion or less in assets) often view a small business as one in which the owner “wears many hats,” referring to an owner who performs multiple tasks, perhaps because the firm is starting up or still in its early growth stage. Large banks define small business more formally in terms of annual revenues and sales.
• Likewise, the definition of small farm varies. For example, the Farm Credit System and parts of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) each define small farm or ranch as one with gross annual sales of less than $250,000. The USDA Economic Research Service, for statistical purposes, defines small farm as one having less than $350,000 of gross cash farm income. SBA defines small farms as those having less than $5 million in annual sales. The CRA definition of small farm loan is $500,000 or less.
     The Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-121) also requires the CFPB to address issues that could potentially have significant economic impacts on small entities subject to the Section 1071 rule.16 The CFPB had to consider, for example, key

Section 1071: Small Business Lending Data Collection and Reporting
 differences in the lending models of large and small lenders, which affect the type and cost of data that would be collected.17
First, large and small lenders often collect different types of data. Large lenders typically engage in lending to borrowers who possess more conventional financial metrics and documentation (e.g., sales fluctuations, costs of inputs, specific industry factors), which is considered hard information that can be used in automated and statistical underwriting methodologies to price loans.18 By contrast, small lenders typically engage in relationship lending, meaning that they must develop close familiarity with their customers to gather soft information, which contains circumstantial details about factors such as non-standardized business risks, insufficient collateral, or weak or thin (business) credit histories. Because of soft information, the loan underwriting process to determine more customized loan products and loan pricing is generally less algorithmic and more labor intensive.19
Second, the type of information collected, which varies among lenders, would also be expected to influence their reporting costs. For example, because hard information is already quite uniform, large lenders may already have adopted automated technological systems that can handle large volumes of standardized and digitized financial data. In these cases, reporting is likely to be less expensive per applicant. By contrast, soft information is more unique to applicant circumstances, infrequent, and localized such that standardization of the data for electronic collection and reporting purposes is challenging. The reporting cost per applicant is also likely to be more expensive for small lenders that lack the volume of applications to justify the costs to convert soft information to digital and secure formats. Therefore, data likely to be informative about lending gaps in the small business and farm credit markets may be more difficult to standardize and more costly to collect, especially if small lenders predominantly serve these markets.
The CFPB also had to consider how Section 1071 implementation requirements might affect the supply of small business loans. For example, some institutions might decide to offer more standardized, less tailored financial products to reduce their reporting costs. Some lenders might require minimum principal loan amounts (e.g., $100,000) to ensure that the loans generate enough revenue to cover the costs to fund and report data, thereby leaving gaps in credit markets for many businesses that are starting up or small. In short, Section 1071 implementation, which is designed to identify any lending gaps, could potentially exacerbate lending gaps in various credit market segments without careful consideration of the potential impact of its requirements.

USER REQUEST:
What is the difference between hard information and soft information?","Hard information refers to conventional financial metrics and documentation, such as sales fluctuations, costs of inputs, and specific industry factors, used in automated and statistical underwriting methodologies to price loans (Congressional Research Service 3).

Soft information contains circumstantial details about factors such as non-standardized business risks, insufficient collateral, or weak or thin (business) credit histories. It is gathered through close familiarity with customers in relationship lending and makes the loan underwriting process generally less algorithmic and more labor intensive (Congressional Research Service 3).","That's a great question, and the document provides a clear distinction between ""hard information"" and ""soft information"" in the context of business lending.

Here's a breakdown of the differences:

**Hard Information:**

*   **What it is:** This refers to conventional, standardized, and easily quantifiable financial metrics and documentation.
*   **Examples:** Sales fluctuations, costs of inputs, specific industry factors, and other objective data points.
*   **Who uses it:** Typically collected by **large lenders** who often deal with borrowers possessing more established financial histories and standardized documentation.
*   **How it's used:** It's well-suited for automated and statistical underwriting methodologies to efficiently price loans. Because it's uniform, large lenders can often use automated systems for data collection and reporting.
*   **Reporting Costs:** Generally **less expensive** to collect and report per applicant because it's standardized and can be processed by automated technological systems designed for large volumes of data.

**Soft Information:**

*   **What it is:** This encompasses circumstantial, less standardized, and often subjective details about a business and its owner. It's information that requires a deeper, more personal understanding.
*   **Examples:** Non-standardized business risks, insufficient collateral, weak or thin (business) credit histories, the owner's character, local market conditions, or the business's potential for future growth based on personal observation.
*   **Who uses it:** Primarily gathered by **small lenders** who often engage in ""relationship lending,"" meaning they develop a close familiarity with their customers.
*   **How it's used:** The underwriting process with soft information is generally less algorithmic and more labor-intensive. It's crucial for determining customized loan products and pricing, especially for businesses that might not fit conventional lending models (like startups or very small businesses).
*   **Reporting Costs:** Often **more expensive** to collect and report per applicant. Because it's unique, infrequent, and localized, standardizing it for electronic collection and reporting is challenging. Small lenders, in particular, may lack the volume of applications to justify the costs of converting this nuanced information into digital and secure formats.

In essence, **hard information is about numbers and verifiable facts** that can be easily compared and automated, while **soft information is about context, relationships, and subjective insights** that are harder to quantify but can be crucial for assessing risk in certain lending scenarios. The document highlights that the challenge for regulators like the CFPB is that this crucial ""soft information"" is also the most difficult and costly to standardize and collect for data reporting purposes."

The management of the complexity does not try to avoid the conflict existing inside the process of human vs. product interaction by modifying the user behavior. Instead, to reduce the complexity is necessary to alter the suggested tasks for that product, and which are susceptible of being modified by the future user. This modification made by the person is dynamic, such as the evolutionary process of adaptation of the product to his own preferences. But this spectrum of changes must be contemplated inside the original plans of the product conceptualization. Then, the existing level of complexity must be measured by the agent (user) skills. From this point we have two possibilities to define the level of complexity. The first one is aims to identify the level of complexity inside the prescribed activity to be made the agent. And the second possibility is related to the skills or incompetence of the agent. This works with the level of instruction of the human being related to the product that will use. This consideration is important, because it will show in which extend the product will satisfy the users expected necessities.

To deal with the components of the system and avoiding its complexity is important to define clearly the kind of model and its final target use. In many situations, the intention of creating ways to demonstrate and clarifying the functions of the product has as a consequence a highly complex product with high cost and underutilization functionality, because the agent (user) is not properly defined or over assisted. 

While analyzing a group of students, by using a observation and non interventional methodology, was detected the “rookie intention to provide the highest technology to they projects, without considering the total information of users capability or the target of the product under development. Is know, that the intention is the best, but this could generate new problems instead of solve the older. The human evolutionary capability must provide him conditions to assimilate new technologies, but this is not a clearly condition because it depends on his social group and the way it conditions that evolutionary process. So, if this dynamic process is not really understood, the conceptualization of a new product could overestimate the learning capability (increasing the mental load to restrict management levels), generating uncontrollable interface andhigh-level complexity that demands a rework of the tasks defined for that product. An example for this situation, level of product complexity, is the Wi-Fi router. On one side the user operates it and understand it as a easy way of connectivity of its electronic appliances without physic contact (this demands a basic information of its use). On the other side a physic scientist will analyze from another perspective, like radiation, signal intensity or electromagnetic behaviors. So, this is a situation when the complexity achieves highest level, needing to incorporate the interface as its own domain [8].

USER REQUEST:
How could having overly high expectations for the diverse functionality of a product not be good for the user? How could this be more harmful to the product experience?","Having overly high expectations for the diverse functionality of a product can lead to a highly complex product with high cost and underutilization functionality because the user is not properly defined or is over-assisted (The management of the complexity does not try to avoid the conflict existing inside the process of human vs. product interaction by modifying the user behavior).

Having overly high expectations for a product's diverse functionality can actually create more problems than it solves for the user and significantly harm the overall product experience.

Here's a breakdown of why, based on the principles discussed:

### How Overly High Expectations for Functionality Can Be Bad for the User:

1.  **Increased Mental Load and Complexity:** When a product is designed with a vast array of features, it often becomes inherently complex. As the document states, this can ""overestimate the learning capability (increasing the mental load to restrict management levels),"" making it harder for the user to understand, learn, and operate the product effectively. Users might feel overwhelmed or even incompetent.
2.  **Uncontrollable Interfaces:** A large number of features often leads to cluttered, ""uncontrollable interface[s],"" making it difficult for users to find what they need or perform simple tasks. This can be frustrating and counterintuitive.
3.  **Mismatched Skills and Needs:** Developers, especially those with a ""rookie intention to provide the highest technology,"" might design for capabilities far beyond what the average user possesses or truly needs. The document highlights that complexity ""must be measured by the agent (user) skills."" If the product demands too much skill or instruction, it won't satisfy the user's expected necessities.
4.  **Underutilization and Wasted Effort:** A highly complex product with many features often results in ""underutilization functionality."" Users may only use a small fraction of the available features because the others are too difficult to access, understand, or simply irrelevant to their core needs. This means the user isn't getting full value for the complexity or potentially higher cost.
5.  **New Problems Instead of Solutions:** The intention might be ""the best,"" but adding too much can ""generate new problems instead of solve the older."" Instead of simplifying tasks, an overly functional product can introduce new hurdles related to setup, troubleshooting, or everyday use.

### How This Can Be More Harmful to the Product Experience:

1.  **Frustration and Dissatisfaction:** When a product is too complex or difficult to use, it leads directly to user frustration. The joy of a seamless experience is replaced by the irritation of struggling with an interface or failing to achieve a desired outcome. This significantly erodes overall user satisfaction.
2.  **Steep Learning Curve and Abandonment:** Users might give up on learning the product entirely if the initial effort is too high. If they can't easily perform core tasks, they might seek simpler alternatives, leading to low adoption or even abandonment of the product.
3.  **Perception of Poor Value:** A ""highly complex product with high cost"" that is underutilized feels like a poor investment. Users feel they've paid for capabilities they can't or won't use, diminishing their perceived value of the product.
4.  **Damaged Brand Reputation:** A frustrating user experience can lead to negative reviews, poor word-of-mouth, and a damaged brand reputation. People remember products that are difficult to use more vividly than those that are just 'okay'.
5.  **Disconnect from User Goals:** As illustrated by the Wi-Fi router example, an everyday user often wants ""an easy way of connectivity."" If the product's design focuses on the scientific intricacies of radiation or signal intensity (high-level complexity) rather than straightforward usability, it creates a fundamental disconnect that harms the user's primary goal and experience. The product fails to adapt to the user's preferences and skill set.

In essence, focusing too much on packing in diverse functionality without deeply understanding the user's actual needs and capabilities can turn a potentially helpful tool into a cumbersome burden, ultimately detracting from the very experience it aims to enhance. Good design often means knowing what to leave out, simplifying tasks, and ensuring the product truly adapts to the user rather than forcing the user to adapt to its complexity."
"DOCUMENT:
Breaking the Habit of Being Yourself
By
Dr.Joe Dispenza
Big Idea #1: To Change Your Life, Change Your Thoughts
This idea is actually in the very first chapter of the book. Dr. Joe Dispenza starts
off explaining how our beliefs or thoughts, lead to our feelings which lead to
our actions which ultimately leads to our results. This is exactly the same as the
concept of ‘TFAR’ in T. Harv Eker’s book ‘The Millionaire Mind”. However,
instead of giving simple practical examples, Dr. Joe Dispenza uses the concept
of Quantum Physics and other physics concepts to prove this point.
Basically, everything in the physical universe is made up of subatomic particles
such as electrons. These particles exist as pure potential. They are in their
wave state when they’re not being observed. These particles are potential
‘everything’ and ‘nothing’ until they are observed. Hence everything in our
physical reality exists as pure potential. What Dispenza means by being
‘observed’ is when we don’t actively look out for it. But when we do see it and
‘observe’ it, we can start to act upon it.
What this ultimately implies is that the quantum field or the universe for this
matter contains a reality in anything you want. So if you want to become a
millionaire, the universe contains a reality in which you are a millionaire. And 
since our consciousness has effects on energy, we are powerful enough to
influence matter. (I know this is a bit too technical but stay with me).
Now, the whole point of using this concept of quantum physics is to prove only
one point. We can master our skills of observation to intentionally affect our
destiny, our life, and our results. In this case, Dispenza uses ‘observation’ to
mean we can master what we ‘focus’ on to change our results. To quote Henry
Ford:
“Whether you think you can, or you think you can’t, you’re right” – Henry Ford
For example, I had a friend who was quite miserable at his job. He wanted a
pay rise but didn’t think he’d deserve it so he would never ask. A month later,
something happened at work and he was blamed for something he didn’t do.
He was really mad and thought staying in this job just isn’t worth it for the
amount of pay he was getting. So he wanted to quit. But before he quit, he
asked for a pay rise first because he had nothing to lose. To his surprise, his
boss actually gave him a 10% pay rise. He was delighted and didn’t end up
quitting.
Now the sudden change in his thoughts to think of himself worthy of getting a
pay rise – was the change in his skill to ‘observe’, his ability to change his
‘focus’. He first focused on how h ewasn’t worth an increase in salary to
focussing on the fact that the job wasn’t worth him staying. Dispenza says that
that the potential of him getting that salary increase was always there. It was
there even when he was miserable a month earlier. In fact, even if his job
would say no, there still exists a potential situation in the universe where he’d
get a 10% pay increase. Maybe this would’ve been through another job.
Whatever it is you want, the potential is there. The only missing link is whether
we have the ability to ‘observe’, to change our ‘focus’ to look it or not.
Big Idea #2: Live Your Desired New Future In the Present
Dispenza teaches us that our brain doesn’t know the difference between the
internal world (what we imagine in our heads) to what we experience in the
external environment. That is, our thoughts can become our experience. This is
what Napoleon Hill also said in his book Think & Grow Rich. The reason why we
think how we think and do what we do is not that of who we are. Remember,
we only act because of our thoughts. This concept is extremely important
because as quoted above, we can imagine ourselves being someone totally
different. We can imagine a more successful life with more confidence, with
more friends and so on. This is a very similar concept of “The New Self Image”
by Maxwell Maltz in his book Psycho-Cybernetics.
When explaining these kinds of concepts, I like to break it down even more. In
layman’s terms, if you’re able to imagine success and everything that it
involves in vivid details, even down to the amount of money and house
structure. And live that life in the present, meaning living that success right
now in the present regardless of your situations, you will manifest it. For
example if you want to become a millionaire. Think of how a millionaire would
think, act, do, how their house would look like etc. First act in that way. And
you will slowly attract the quantum potential of you being a millionaire into
your life. It’s like, first you have to be a millionaire kind of person to actually
become a millionaire.
Now, I know this may sound very weird and bit B.S. but here are some
examples that you may relate to. Think of manifesting like dating. For example,
imagine your perfect ideal partner in life. You don’t really care about the nitty
gritty of how they look but you have to be attracted to them and they have to
have the same values and be ambitious in life. Now imagine if they existed,
what would they want in their perfect partner? They would want you to also
be established. Be caring. Be funny. All that. So even if you’d meet your perfect
partner in real life, you’d miss your chance because you’re not the type of
person they’re looking for. Chances are even if they’d walk past you on the
streets, you won’t even see or notice them because deep down you don’t think
you deserve them so you don’t look out for them. Hence think of manifesting
like dating. You have to become first, then you will receive.
So applying this concept to the previous scenario with my friend wanting to
earn 100k, if he just acted, and thought of himself as already being a 100k type
of person, asking for that pay rise would be a no brainer to him. Another
example is if you want to become a public speaker – the kind that gets invited
speak on TED Talks. First treat yourself as that kind of person already and you
will slowly see more opportunities to public speak. It’s all about changing our
focus to become better ‘observers’ so that we can attract our goal into our life.
These questions will help you find your desired new future. Also, when you’re
done answering these questions and have a better understanding what your
new desired future looks like. Remember not to live in the future but to bring it
to the present. Live it in the present and feel the emotions, feel the happiness
and feel everything that comes with it. More importantly, act and think like
you’re living in the future but in the present. So when choices comes up and
when situations arrives, deal with them as if the future you is dealing with
them.
Big Idea #3: Three Brains: From Thinking To Doing To Being
We have three brains. The first brain is the Neocortex, which is responsible for
our thoughts. The second brain is the Limbic brain, which is responsible for our
emotions. The third brain is the Cerebellum, which is responsible for our
habitual thoughts, attitudes, and behaviors.
And this is how we learn things. First, we think about the new concept, then
we act on the new concept. Once we act on it enough, we can be the new
concept.
For example, you don’t want to have as much of a temper anymore so instead
you want to learn how to be more compassionate. So you immerse yourself in 
studying compassionate people like Mother Teresa and the Dalai Lama.
Everything on how they think, act and what they believed. Now you know
exactly how to think like them.
The second step after thinking is doing. So a situation comes up where your
partner does something you extremely hate. If that was the old you, you
would’ve started an argument. But since you just studied how to be
compassionate, you start to act compassionately instead. At this stage,
Dispenza explains that the act of doing represents us teaching our body what
our mind has learned. So the first step was for the mind to learn. This second
step is for the body to learn.
But acting compassionate in only one situation doesn’t necessarily make you a
compassionate person. So what you have to do is act it out repeatedly. Only
when you act compassionate repeatedly enough, you’ll move on to ‘being‘
compassionate. At this stage, Dispenza explains you no longer have to think of
being compassionate, you just are. Being is when your body acts without
needing a signal from the mind. It’s natural, routine, second nature and
unconscious.
He goes further to say that to master being is when our internal chemical state
is greater than anything in our external world. That is no matter how many
times someone pushes your buttons or no matter how messy the house looks,
nothing in your external environment can make you get mad since you want to
be compassionate.
And the thing is this might sound foreign to you. As if ‘mastery’ is something
very difficult to achieve. But the truth is, we have attained the mastery level. 
Just not on traits we might like. In fact Dispenza says ‘if you can master
suffering, you can just as easily master joy’ – Dr. Joe Dispenza To demonstrate
this I have to give you this example from the book which I find demonstrates
this so well and at the same time is hilarious.
You probably know someone who has mastered suffering, right? So you call
her and ask, “How are you?” She answers “So-So.” You go on and say “Listen,
I’m going to go out with some friends to a new art gallery and then eat at this
restaurant that has really healthy desserts. Afterward, we’re going to listen to
some live music. Would you like to come with us?” And after a long pause,
your friend answers “No. I don’t feel like it.”
But if she said what she actually meant, she’d say, I’ve memorized this
emotional state, and nothing in my environment – no person, no experience,
no condition, no thing – is going to move me from my internal chemical state
of suffering. It feels better to be in pain than to let go and be happy. I am
enjoying my addiction for now, and all these things that you want to do might
distract me from my emotional dependency.
So guess what? We can just as easily master an internal chemical state such as
joy or compassion as we can and we do for suffering. This also goes mastering
our internal state of thinking we’re not good enough. Which is the most
common internal state most of us have.
Big Idea #4: The Identity Gap
This was one of my favorite ideas from the book. I could resonate with this
idea. Dispenza starts off the chapter by telling us what kind of person he used
to be before all of this. He had the money, he had the job, he traveled around
the world to teach and he had a great family. From the outside, it looked like 
his life was perfect. But even he didn’t know why even having the perfect life
didn’t make him happy. And no it didn’t have anything to do with being
grateful for what he had. It was the fact that there was a huge gap in his two
identities.
Dispenza explains that everyone has two identities: The first is the identity of
how you see yourself. The second is the identity of how you appear to others.
There’s a gap because we usually don’t want others to see who we truly are
inside. So it’s like we put on this front and have two identities. The thing is the
second identity was actually created by us to hide our first identity. But now
and then the first identity (our true identity) comes out and we try suppressing
it further by changing our external world. But what we actually have to do is
change our internal world. Dispenza defines happiness as closing this gap.
The gap was created because we memorized many emotional layers such as
unworthiness, anger, fear, shame, self-doubt, and guilt. Hence our life’s aim is
to close this gap. To really show who we truly are inside. This is what will make
us ultimately fulfilled. Being self-expressed creates happiness. And we can do
this by unlearning and un-memorizing these emotional states.
We can do it the long way as explained in Big Idea #3, but the faster way,
which is to skip from thinking to just being can be done through meditation.
That’s when Dispenza introduces his Step By Step Meditation Guide to do just
that.
Big Idea #5: Breaking The Habit Of Being Yourself Through Meditation
Dispenza explains that one of the main purposes of meditation is to go beyond
the conscious mind and enter the subconscious mind, in order to change selfdestructive habits, behaviors, belief, emotional reactions, attitudes, and
unconscious states of being. That is, we can skip the doing, to go straight from
thinking to being.
The power of meditation actually allows us to become more observant within
ourselves. It allows us to break our emotional bond with the body, the
environment and time. This helps with “Breaking The Habits Of Being Yourself”
and helps with creating new thoughts and emotions that are congruent with
the new future you. We can actually skip the acting part and just move into
being through meditation.
Hence Part 3 of the book includes a step-by-step guide to Meditation. It’s a 6-
week program where Dr. Joe Dispenza shares tools, resources, how to and the
reason behind everything. Unlike other books that only just have concepts and
little action plans. Dr. Joe Dispenza has gone out of his way to explain every
little step and to designing a meditation specifically aimed to have you break
the habit of being yourself. He even includes guided meditations and many
other resources on his website to help best perform this meditation.
Conclusion:
As you can see Breaking The Habit Of Being Yourself reviews concepts that are
quite philosophical. I’ve read many similar books like Psycho-Cybernetics,
Think & Grow Rich, Secrets Of The Millionaire Mind and The Magic Of Thinking
Big just to name a few. They all share one important key concept that actions
and results all start from our thoughts.
Breaking The Habits Of Being Yourself doesn’t just say statements like ‘Change
your thoughts to change your life’, instead it taps into many different concepts
of physics, biology, neuroscience and many others to prove that this is not just
philosophical but instead a fact. A fact that not many people are taking
advantage of.
I guess my last words on this is that if you’re willing to be open minded and
take the book for what it is instead of nit picking every little thing and actually
apply the strategies it shares, I’m certain it will have a positive impact on your 
life. Go ahead, give it a read and break the habit of being yourself to become
the new you.
Your Breaking The Habit Of Being Yourself Action Plan
Choose your top 3 new traits.For example being compassionate, being bold
and caring. Immerse yourself into studying on how to be just that by
researching famous figures who embody that trait.
Act out those 3 traits.Whenever you get a chance, ask yourself “What would a
compassionate person do?” And do this. Do this enough times until you don’t
need to consciously remember to be compassionate anymore. Do this for all 3
traits.
Unlearn your worst 3 traits. Choose the top 3 traits that you don’t like about
yourself. This could also include beliefs about yourself. Beliefs such as I’m not
good enough. To unlearn it, take actions no matter how small to prove that
you are good enough. And when you do, consciously write them down so you
can remember it. Once you build up this bank of examples where you proved
to yourself that you are good enough, slowly your old belief will just fall away.
Of course, you can also do the meditation to unlearn these traits quicker.
However, I’d suggest reading the book first in this case.
Quotes:
“Can you accept the notion that once you change your internal state, you don’t need the external
world to provide you with a reason to feel joy, gratitude, appreciation, or any other elevated
emotion?”
“A memory without the emotional charge is called wisdom.”
“We should never wait for science to give us permission to do the uncommon; if we do, then we
are turning science into another religion.”
“If you want a new outcome, you will have to break the habit of being yourself, and reinvent a
new self.”
“Think of it this way: the input remains the same, so the output has to remain the same. How,
then, can you ever create anything new?”
“The quantum field responds not to what we want; it responds to who we are being.”
“By Itself, Conscious Positive Thinking Cannot Overcome Subconscious Negative Feelings”

What are Joe Dispenza's core teachings?","Joe Dispenza's core teachings, as outlined in the document, revolve around several ""Big Ideas"":

*   **To Change Your Life, Change Your Thoughts:** Dispenza explains that beliefs and thoughts lead to feelings, actions, and ultimately results, proving this point using concepts from Quantum Physics. He asserts that everything in physical reality exists as pure potential and that our consciousness can influence matter, allowing us to master our skills of observation (focus) to intentionally affect our destiny, life, and results (Big Idea #1).
*   **Live Your Desired New Future In the Present:** Dispenza teaches that the brain doesn't differentiate between imagined internal experiences and external environmental experiences, meaning thoughts can become experiences. He suggests imagining a desired future in vivid detail and living that life in the present to manifest it, effectively becoming the type of person who would achieve that future (Big Idea #2).
*   **Three Brains: From Thinking To Doing To Being:** Dispenza identifies three brains (Neocortex for thoughts, Limbic brain for emotions, Cerebellum for habitual thoughts, attitudes, and behaviors) and explains that learning involves thinking about a new concept, acting on it repeatedly, and eventually ""being"" it. ""Being"" means the body acts without a signal from the mind, becoming natural and unconscious. He states that mastering ""being"" means our internal chemical state is greater than anything in our external world (Big Idea #3).
*   **The Identity Gap:** Dispenza posits that everyone has two identities: how they see themselves and how they appear to others. Happiness, according to him, is achieved by closing this gap, which is created by memorized emotional layers like unworthiness, anger, fear, shame, self-doubt, and guilt. The aim is to unlearn these emotional states to show one's true self, leading to fulfillment and happiness (Big Idea #4).
*   **Breaking The Habit Of Being Yourself Through Meditation:** Dispenza explains that a main purpose of meditation is to go beyond the conscious mind into the subconscious to change self-destructive habits, behaviors, beliefs, emotional reactions, attitudes, and unconscious states of being. Meditation allows individuals to skip the ""doing"" phase and move straight from ""thinking"" to ""being,"" fostering new thoughts and emotions congruent with a desired future (Big Idea #5).","Dr. Joe Dispenza, through his book *Breaking the Habit of Being Yourself*, offers a powerful framework for personal transformation, asserting that we have the ability to intentionally create our reality. His core teachings blend spiritual wisdom with concepts from quantum physics, biology, and neuroscience, making a strong case for the power of our minds.

Here are the main ideas he emphasizes:

1.  **Your Thoughts Create Your Reality:** Dispenza teaches that our beliefs and thoughts directly influence our feelings, which then drive our actions, ultimately leading to our results. He elevates this concept by explaining it through quantum physics. He posits that everything in the physical universe exists as pure potential until observed. Our consciousness and what we ""focus"" on acts as the observer, collapsing these potentials into our reality. This means if you want to be a millionaire, that potential already exists in the quantum field, and your focus can help bring it into being. It's all about mastering our ""skill of observation"" or what we choose to ""focus"" on. As Henry Ford famously said, ""Whether you think you can, or you think you can’t, you’re right.""

2.  **Live Your Desired Future in the Present:** A crucial teaching is that your brain doesn't distinguish between what you imagine vividly in your mind (internal world) and what you experience in the external world. By consciously imagining your desired future—who you want to be, what you want to achieve—and living *as if* that future is already your present reality, you can begin to manifest it. This means thinking, acting, and feeling like the person you aspire to become right now, regardless of your current circumstances. He uses the analogy of dating: to attract your ideal partner, you first need to *become* the type of person that partner would want. Similarly, to attract a new reality, you must *be* that new self first.

3.  **The Journey from Thinking to Doing to Being (Three Brains):** Dispenza explains human transformation through the functions of three brains:
    *   **Neocortex (Thinking):** Where we learn new concepts intellectually.
    *   **Limbic Brain (Doing):** Where we act on those new concepts, teaching our body what our mind has learned. This stage requires conscious effort and repetition.
    *   **Cerebellum (Being):** The stage of mastery, where the new concept becomes a natural, unconscious part of you – a habit. You no longer have to think about it; you simply *are* it. For example, to become more compassionate, you first learn about it, then consciously practice compassionate actions, and eventually, you simply become a compassionate person, where it's your default internal state, independent of external triggers. He cleverly points out that we've all mastered ""being"" in certain ways, even if it's ""mastering suffering"" or ""being not good enough.""

4.  **Close the ""Identity Gap"":** Dispenza highlights that many people experience unhappiness due to a gap between ""who they truly are inside"" (their first identity) and ""how they appear to others"" (their second identity). This gap is often created by emotional layers like unworthiness, fear, or self-doubt, leading us to put on a ""front."" True happiness and fulfillment come from closing this gap, unlearning these old emotional states, and allowing our authentic selves to be expressed.

5.  **Meditation as a Tool for Transformation:** To effectively ""break the habit of being yourself"" and close the identity gap, Dispenza emphasizes meditation. He teaches that meditation allows us to go beyond the conscious mind and access the subconscious, where our deep-seated habits, beliefs, and emotional reactions reside. By doing so, we can bypass the ""doing"" stage and move directly from ""thinking"" to ""being"" a new, desired self. It enables us to become more observant of our inner world, detach from emotional bonds to our past, environment, and even time, thus creating new thoughts and emotions aligned with our desired future.

In essence, Dr. Joe Dispenza's core teachings empower you to take control of your internal world to consciously design your external reality. He provides a roadmap, grounded in both ancient wisdom and modern science, for unlearning limiting patterns and consciously stepping into a new, desired self, emphasizing that our internal state is far more powerful than any external circumstance."
"DOCUMENT:
Issues Presented to the Ninth Circuit on Appeal
Attorneys for Montana unsuccessfully argued to the district court that the law represents a valid exercise
of Montana’s police power, that it does not violate any of the claimed constitutional provisions, that
federal law does not preempt the ban, and that the ban would have only an indirect, and thus permissible,
effect on interstate commerce. Montana then appealed the district court’s order granting the preliminary
injunction to the Ninth Circuit.
In its opening brief, Montana asserts that SB 419 has a “common sense consumer protection purpose” and
that the district court erred in concluding that TikTok and its users would win their constitutional
arguments. Montana also argues that the district court erred in its application of the remaining preliminary
injunction factors. A selection of Montana’s various arguments, ordered as they appear in the brief,
follows:
• Police Powers. Montana asserts that protecting consumers is an exercise of police power,
under which states have significant discretion.
• Data Access. Montana asserts that, based on news reports, the U.S. user data that TikTok
collects likely is available to the PRC at will, underscoring that the Montana legislature
enacted SB 419 to protect Montana consumers’ data privacy, not to impact the editorial
control of the platform.
• Burden Shifting. Montana asserts that the district court, in concluding that TikTok and
its users would prevail on their constitutional claims, erroneously shifted the evidentiary
burden for proving those claims to Montana.
The Ninth Circuit’s review of the district court’s order granting the preliminary injunction is limited.
Montana asks the court of appeals to hold that the district court abused its discretion by relying on “an
erroneous legal standard” or “clearly erroneous factual findings” (internal quotation marks omitted).
Montana emphasizes that a preliminary injunction is a “drastic remedy” that should not issue where a
plaintiff’s claim is “merely plausible” (internal quotation marks omitted). Virginia, together with 18 other
states, filed an amicus brief in support of Montana.
TikTok and its users each filed a response brief in late April 2024. They maintain that the district court
acted properly and emphasize various arguments, including those that follow (ordered as they appear in
the briefs):
• First Amendment. TikTok and its users argue that the preliminary injunction is justified
because SB 419 violates the First Amendment and the law does not withstand any level
of scrutiny that might be applied.
• Supremacy Clause (Preemption). TikTok and its users argue that SB 419 impermissibly
conflicts with the Defense Production Act and constitutes an improper incursion into
foreign affairs.
• Commerce Clause. TikTok and its users argue that SB 419 likely violates the Commerce
Clause by impeding the flow of interstate commerce.
These arguments largely reflect those made before the district court. Between Montana’s filing and the
response briefs, Congress passed PAFACAA. The response briefs include mention of this new law to
underscore arguments in favor of federal preemption. TikTok has also brought a pre-enforcement
challenge of the federal law in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. In the present matter, the
Ninth Circuit must weigh the various arguments to determine whether the district court properly
considered and applied the legal standards governing whether to grant a preliminary injunction before a
final determination on the merits of the claims could be made.

*   SB 419 likely violates the Commerce Clause by impeding the flow of interstate commerce (TikTok and its users argue that SB 419 likely violates the Commerce Clause by impeding the flow of interstate commerce.).","This is quite a fascinating legal battle playing out in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals! Here's a summary of the main arguments from both sides regarding Montana's ban on TikTok:

### Montana's Stance: Defending the Ban

Montana's attorneys are arguing that the district court was wrong to issue a preliminary injunction blocking the TikTok ban (SB 419). Their key points include:

*   **Protecting Consumers through Police Powers:** Montana asserts that the ban is a legitimate exercise of its ""police powers"" – the inherent authority of states to enact laws for the health, safety, and welfare of their citizens. They believe protecting consumers, especially their data privacy, falls squarely within this power, allowing states significant discretion.
*   **Data Privacy Concerns:** Montana highlights news reports suggesting that U.S. user data collected by TikTok could be accessible to the People's Republic of China (PRC). They argue the law's primary purpose is to safeguard Montana consumers' data privacy, not to control the platform's content or editorial decisions.
*   **Burden of Proof Errors:** They contend that the district court incorrectly shifted the burden of proof to Montana, requiring the state to disprove constitutional violations rather than requiring TikTok and its users to fully prove their claims.
*   **Preliminary Injunction Standards:** Montana emphasizes that a preliminary injunction is a ""drastic remedy."" They argue it shouldn't be granted based on ""merely plausible"" claims and that the district court ""abused its discretion"" by potentially relying on incorrect legal standards or factual findings.
*   **No Constitutional Violations, Preemption, or Commerce Clause Issues:** Montana continues to argue, as they did in the district court, that the law doesn't violate any constitutional provisions (like the First Amendment), isn't preempted by federal law, and would only have an indirect, and thus permissible, effect on interstate commerce.

Essentially, Montana believes it has a right to protect its citizens from perceived data security risks and that the district court overstepped in blocking its law. They even have the support of Virginia and 18 other states, who filed an amicus brief backing Montana's position.

### TikTok and Its Users' Stance: Challenging the Ban

TikTok and its users are vigorously defending the district court's preliminary injunction, arguing that Montana's ban is unconstitutional and unlawful. Their main arguments include:

*   **First Amendment Violation:** This is a core argument. TikTok and its users assert that SB 419 violates their First Amendment rights to free speech. They maintain that the law restricts access to and dissemination of information and creative content, and that it cannot withstand the various levels of judicial scrutiny applied to such restrictions.
*   **Federal Preemption (Supremacy Clause):** They argue that federal law already governs areas like national security and foreign affairs. They specifically contend that SB 419 conflicts with the federal Defense Production Act and represents an improper intrusion into matters that are the exclusive domain of the federal government. They've even brought in the recently passed federal law, PAFACAA, which gives the President power to ban TikTok nationwide, to further bolster their preemption argument, suggesting that Congress intends to handle such issues at a federal level.
*   **Commerce Clause Violation:** TikTok and its users argue that the ban likely violates the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution. They contend that by banning a platform used by millions across state lines, Montana's law unduly burdens and impedes the free flow of interstate commerce.
*   **District Court Acted Properly:** They maintain that the district court correctly applied the legal standards and properly granted the preliminary injunction, finding that TikTok and its users had a strong likelihood of succeeding on their constitutional claims.

In essence, TikTok and its users believe Montana's ban is an overreach of state power that infringes on fundamental rights and interferes with federal authority and interstate commerce.

The Ninth Circuit's role now is to meticulously review these arguments to determine whether the district court made the correct decision in granting that initial preliminary injunction. It's a critical step in a case that could have significant implications for digital platforms and state regulatory powers."

WEB PAGES
Web pages are what make up the World Wide Web. These documents are written in
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and are translated by your Web browser. Web pages can
either be static or dynamic. Static pages show the same content each time they are viewed.
Dynamic pages have content that can change each time they are accessed. These pages are
typically written in scripting languages such as PHP, Perl, ASP, or JSP. The scripts in the pages
run functions on the server that return things like the date and time, and database information.
All the information is returned as HTML code, so when the page gets to your browser, all the
browser has to do is translate the HTML.
Electronic (digital) document created with HTML and, therefore, accessible with a
browser. In addition to text and graphics, web pages may also contain downloadable data files,
audio and video files, and hyperlinks to other pages or sites. A website is usually a collection of
web pages. A web page is a document that's created in html that shows up on the internet when
you type in or go to the web page's address.

Web pages are created using HTML which stands for HyperText Markup Language. All
web pages, whether big or small, have to be developed in HTML to be displayed in web
browsers. HTML, contrary to its name, is not a language. Rather, it consists of tags that specify
the purpose of what they enclose. For instance, by surrounding a block of text on a web page
with the <p> tag (the paragraph tag) tells the browser that all that text is to be placed as
paragraph or using the <em> around a phrase will give emphasis to it.
7
Types of Web Pages
Advocacy Web pages established for political candidates, called “e-campaigning,” has
become an important part of politics. Surveys show that more than 50 percent of Internet users
turn to the Web for information about political topics.
Business/marketing Web pages used for shopping on the Internet are increasingly
popular. In 1999, 17 million households shopped online. This figure is expected to grow to 49
million by 2004. A survey of back-to-school shoppers 34 years old and younger showed that 17
percent planned to shop online for their children’s school needs. Perhaps more significant, only 6
percent of surveyed shoppers reported being uncomfortable with buying on the Internet.
Educational institutions frequently publish informational Web pages. Today, most colleges have
web sites that offer course descriptions, information about the student population, and
registration costs and deadlines. When shopping for college, surveys show that high school
seniors use the Web more than catalogs or guidebooks; about 80 percent of college-bound
students start looking at college Web sites as sophomores.
News Web pages are the most popular Web sites among Americans with access to the
Internet. Although these Web sites often are associated with newspapers, magazines, television
stations, or radio stations, some are published only online, without a related print or broadcast
media.
Portal Web pages often offer the following free services: search engine, news, sports and
weather, free personal Web pages, reference tools, shopping malls, e-mail, instant messaging,
newsgroups, and chat rooms. The dictionary defines a “portal” as a door or gateway. Portal Web
pages are gateways to a host of services.
INTERNET CHAT
On the Internet, chatting is talking to other people who are using the Internet at the same
time you are. Usually, this ""talking"" is the exchange of typed-in messages requiring one site as
the repository for the messages (or ""chat site"") and a group of users who take part from anywhere
on the Internet.
In some cases, a private chat can be arranged between two parties who meet initially in a
group chat. Chats can be ongoing or scheduled for a particular time and duration. Most chats are
focused on a particular topic of interest and some involve guest experts or famous people who
""talk"" to anyone joining the chat.

In the multicurrency era, domestic public 
 debt reforms include the adoption of the cash 
 budgeting system and introduction of new 
 government securities in secondary market. 
 According to the 2009 budget statement, the 
 Government of National Unity (GNU) 
 effected the cash budgeting system to 
 circumvent further accrual of domestic debt. 
 The cash budgeting system restricted 
 government expenditures to available 
 revenue instead of the cash flow profile 
 associated with approved estimates. The 
 cash budgeting system insulated monetary 
 operations from fiscal operations and the 
 domestic debt market was made inactive. 
 However, in 2014, the government 
 abandoned the cash budgeting system 
 leading to the rejuvenation of excessive 
 fiscal deficits, which aggravated domestic 
 public borrowing and a slowdown in 
 economic growth (IMF, 2015). As a control 
 measure to the rising domestic public 
 indebtedness, the Minister of Finance and 
 Economic Development was instructed by 
 the parliament to set out clearly in the fiscal
 

 policy the volume of net treasury securities 
 issuance to be conducted for fiscal policy 
 purposes each year, and how the raised 
 money would be used (ZEPARU, 2013). 
 Also, in a move meant to end quasi-fiscal 
 activities by the reserve bank, the GNU in 
 2009 appointed the Commercial Bank of 
 Zimbabwe as the state’s bank while 
 modalities were being put in place to restore 
 financial sanity at the apex bank (GoZ, 
 2009a; 2009b).  
 In 2014, the government for the first time 
 started to trade infrastructure bonds (GoZ, 
 2014b). The introduction of the 5-year tenor 
 infrastructure bonds at a fixed interest of 9.5 
 percent, has not only enhanced financial 
 deepening in the economy but also 
 contributed to a paradigm shift in the 
 structure of government debt. Also, the 
 introduction of long term debt instruments 
 by the government was intended at 
 minimising rollover risk and lessen 
 borrowing expenses associated with short 
 term debt (Infrastructure Development Bank 
 of Zimbabwe “IDBZ”, 2016). Until now, the 
 government has raised US$5 million, $15 
 million and $22 million in 2015, 2016 and 
 2017, respectively, through the trading of 
 infrastructure bonds on the capital markets 
 (IDBZ, 2015, 2016; GoZ, 2017). At present, 
 the government debt securities are being 
 traded on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange in 
 the same manner as other stocks.
 

 To provide for the management of public 
 debt in Zimbabwe on a statutory basis, 
 mainly foreign public debt, the public debt 
 reforms included public sector financial 
 reforms and the institutionalisation and 
 operationalisation of a Debt Management 
 Office, which is currently housed in the 
 Ministry of Finance and Economic 
 Development. The responsibilities of the 
 Debt Office are among others, to ensure 
 public debt database validation and 
 reconciliation with all creditors and to 
 provide for the raising, management and 
 servicing of loans by the state
 

 The Public Management Act Amended 
 (2015) further stipulates that the Debt Office 
 shall (1) formulate and publish a Medium 
 Term Debt Management Strategy, (2) 
 formulate and publish an annual borrowing 
 plan, which includes a borrowing limit, and 
 (3) undertake an annual debt sustainability 
 analyses (MOFED, 2012).In 2011, the GNU instituted several foreign 
 policy shifts, intended at reducing the 
 country’s foreign public debt overhang, by 
 re-engaging with creditors and the global 
 community. The intention of the new re
 engagement policy reform was to seek 
 comprehensive debt relief initiatives, as well 
 as opening up new lines of offshore 
 financing.

Through the financial troubles and attempt to fix the economy, how much money has Zimbabwe raised through trading bonds explain in 7 to 10 sentences?","In 2014, the government of Zimbabwe initiated the trading of infrastructure bonds for the first time (GoZ, 2014b). These bonds were introduced as 5-year tenor instruments with a fixed interest rate of 9.5 percent, intended to deepen the financial market and alter the structure of government debt (Infrastructure Development Bank of Zimbabwe “IDBZ”, 2016). The introduction of these long-term debt instruments aimed to minimize rollover risk and reduce borrowing expenses linked to short-term debt (Infrastructure Development Bank of Zimbabwe “IDBZ”, 2016). Through the trading of these infrastructure bonds on the capital markets, the government raised specific amounts over subsequent years (IDBZ, 2015, 2016; GoZ, 2017). In 2015, US$5 million was raised (IDBZ, 2015). This was followed by US$15 million in 2016 (IDBZ, 2016). An additional US$22 million was raised in 2017 (GoZ, 2017). Therefore, up until 2017, the government had cumulatively raised US$42 million through the trading of these infrastructure bonds (IDBZ, 2015, 2016; GoZ, 2017). Currently, government debt securities are traded on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange like other stocks.","Zimbabwe has undertaken several financial reforms to stabilize its economy and manage public debt, including the strategic introduction of new government securities. A significant part of these efforts involved the trading of infrastructure bonds on the capital markets, which began in 2014. These 5-year tenor infrastructure bonds, issued at a fixed interest rate of 9.5 percent, were designed to not only deepen the financial sector but also to shift the structure of government debt towards longer terms. This move aimed to minimize rollover risk and reduce the borrowing expenses typically associated with short-term debt instruments.

Through the trading of these infrastructure bonds, the government successfully raised capital over several years. In 2015, it secured US$5 million, followed by an additional US$15 million in 2016. Building on this momentum, a further US$22 million was raised in 2017 through these market activities. Cumulatively, as part of its strategy to address financial troubles and foster economic stability, Zimbabwe has raised a total of **US$42 million** from 2015 to 2017 through the trading of these infrastructure bonds. This initiative forms a component of wider public debt reforms, which also included institutionalizing a Debt Management Office and re-engaging with creditors to seek comprehensive debt relief."

Is It A Smart Financial Decision To Participate In Cyber Monday?

Cyber Monday is around the corner, promising big online discounts and deals. With its attractive offers and hidden risks, itâ€™s important to understand how Cyber Monday affects your shopping habits and financial health before deciding whether to take part in this major online event.

Benefits Of Cyber Monday

Potential Savings And Discounts

Retailers compete to attract customers during Cyber Monday, resulting in some of the lowest prices of the year on a wide range of products. These discounts arenâ€™t limited to overstock or outdated items; often, they include the latest electronics, fashion, and more.

The key here is the scale and breadth of these discounts, which can apply to both luxury and everyday items, making it a prime opportunity for you to make significant savings on high-ticket items or stock up on essentials.
Convenience And Ease Of Shopping

In todayâ€™s fast-paced world, the ability to shop from anywhere is a significant advantage. This ease of access not only saves time but also reduces the physical and mental stress associated with holiday shopping.

Cyber Monday also simplifies comparing prices across different websites, reading reviews, and making informed choices without the pressure of in-store sales tactics.

Additionally, the online platform allows for a more personalized shopping experience, with algorithms suggesting products that align with your interests and past shopping behavior.

Cyber Monday is known for exclusive deals that are not available at other times of the year. These can include not only price reductions but also bundle deals, where additional products are included at a lower combined cost.

These deals can be particularly appealing for acquiring high-demand items like electronics, designer brands, or new releases, which are rarely discounted at other times.
Finding Unique Or Hard-To-Find Items

Unlike physical stores, which have limited shelf space and tend to stock only the most popular items, online retailers can offer a more diverse range of products.

During Cyber Monday, with its expanded focus on sales, even niche retailers and small businesses participate, offering unique or handcrafted items that arenâ€™t available in mainstream stores.

This aspect of Cyber Monday can be particularly appealing to those looking for specialty items, collectorâ€™s items, or bespoke products.

Drawbacks Of Cyber Monday
Risk Of Overspending

The lure of great deals can sometimes lead to impulsive buying decisions. Consumers often buy items they donâ€™t need, swayed by the perceived value of the discounts.

This risk is heightened during Cyber Monday due to the aggressive marketing tactics employed by retailers, leveraging the scarcity and time-limited nature of deals.

The psychological impact of seeing a countdown timer or a limited stock alert can override rational decision-making, leading to purchases that might not align with your needs or financial capacity.

This can result in financial strain, buyerâ€™s remorse, and unnecessary items, negating the very benefits you sought to gain from the sale.
Scams And Fraudulent Websites

The high volume of online traffic make Cyber Monday a ripe target for scammers. These fraudulent activities can range from creating entirely fake shopping sites that mimic legitimate ones, to more subtle scams, such as selling counterfeit or substandard products.

The risk extends to cybersecurity threats, such as phishing attempts designed to steal personal and financial information. You might end up losing money, compromise your data, or receive inferior products, turning what should have been a savvy shopping experience into a costly mistake.
Potential Delays

Due to the sheer volume of transactions, the risk of delays in shipping and the possibility of popular items being back-ordered are significant. This can be particularly frustrating when purchasing gifts for the holidays, as items may not arrive in time.

The frustration is compounded when customer service lines are overwhelmed, leaving you with little recourse but to wait. If you require immediate product availability, relying on Cyber Monday purchases can be a gamble.
Technological Issues

Websites crashing or slowing down during high-traffic periods can be a major deterrent, with pages taking too long to load or transactions failing to process.

In the worst-case scenario, you might lose out on a deal due to a website crash just as you were about to complete a purchase. This can also raise security concerns, as interrupted transactions might expose your financial details or lead to double-charging.
Factors To Consider In Decision-Making
Financial Situation And Budget

Before diving into Cyber Monday deals, assess your finances. Itâ€™s essential to set a budget and stick to it, ensuring that any purchases made are within your means and donâ€™t lead to financial strain.

It involves scrutinizing your financial health and setting a budget specifically for Cyber Monday shopping. A well-planned budget should account for not only the cost of the items but also any additional expenses, such as shipping or potential return fees.
Shopping Needs And Preferences

Are the items youâ€™re interested in likely to be on sale? Does the convenience of online shopping appeal to you?

For instance, if you are in the market for high-tech gadgets or specific fashion brands, Cyber Monday might offer the best deals. However, for items that donâ€™t typically see significant discounts, it might not be as beneficial.

This assessment also includes considering your shopping habits â€“ whether you enjoy the thrill of finding deals in a time-sensitive environment or prefer a more relaxed, thoughtful shopping experience.
Research And Price Comparison

Price comparison is crucial, as some deals advertised for Cyber Monday might not be as exclusive or advantageous as they seem. Retailers often inflate original prices to make discounts appear more significant.

Additionally, the same product might be available at a lower price at a different time or from a different retailer. Thorough research ensures that the decision to buy is based on the best available information, leading to more satisfactory and value-for-money purchases.
Alternative Shopping Occasions

Consider other sales events throughout the year, such as Black Friday, post-holiday sales, or even random flash sales. Each of these occasions has its own set of advantages.

For example, Black Friday might offer better deals for in-store shopping, while post-holiday sales could be ideal for non-seasonal items. By comparing Cyber Monday with these alternatives, you can determine the best time to purchase the items you need, potentially finding better deals or a shopping experience more suited to your preferences.
Final Thoughts

Whether or not to participate in Cyber Monday depends on your individual circumstances. If youâ€™re a savvy shopper who knows what you want, can stick to a budget, and are comfortable navigating online platforms, Cyber Monday can be a fruitful shopping experience.

If not, there are always other times to shop. Keep an eye out for deals throughout the year, and remember that patience can often lead to better savings without the rush and pressure of a single day event.

Happy shopping! Or not.

What is the case for it not being a smart financial decision to participate in Cyber Monday based on the given information?","The case for it not being a smart financial decision to participate in Cyber Monday is based on several drawbacks:

*   **Risk of Overspending** The lure of great deals can lead to impulsive buying decisions, causing consumers to purchase items they do not need, swayed by the perceived value of discounts (Tamplin). Aggressive marketing tactics, such as scarcity and time-limited deals, can heighten this risk, overriding rational decision-making and potentially leading to financial strain, buyer's remorse, and unnecessary items (Tamplin).
*   **Scams and Fraudulent Websites** Cyber Monday's high online traffic makes it a target for scammers, who may create fake shopping sites, sell counterfeit products, or engage in phishing attempts to steal personal and financial information (Tamplin). This can result in losing money, compromising data, or receiving inferior products (Tamplin).
*   **Potential Delays** Due to the high volume of transactions, there is a significant risk of shipping delays and popular items being back-ordered, which can be frustrating, especially when purchasing holiday gifts that might not arrive on time (Tamplin). Overwhelmed customer service lines can further compound this frustration (Tamplin).
*   **Technological Issues** Websites may crash or slow down during high-traffic periods, leading to long loading times or failed transactions (Tamplin). There is a risk of losing out on a deal due to a website crash or facing security concerns like exposed financial details or double-charging from interrupted transactions (Tamplin).","Cyber Monday can definitely be tempting with all its flashy deals, but based on the information provided, there are several compelling reasons why participating might *not* be a smart financial decision for everyone.

Here's a breakdown of the case against it:

1.  **High Risk of Overspending:** The biggest financial pitfall is the sheer temptation to buy things you don't actually need. Retailers use aggressive marketing tactics like countdown timers and limited stock alerts to create a sense of urgency. This psychological pressure can override rational decision-making, leading to impulsive purchases swayed by the perceived value of a discount, rather than genuine need. You might end up with buyer's remorse, unnecessary items, and financial strain, effectively negating any potential savings.

2.  **Scams and Fraudulent Websites:** The high volume of online traffic during Cyber Monday makes it a prime target for scammers. You could encounter fake shopping sites mimicking legitimate ones, purchase counterfeit or substandard products, or even fall victim to phishing attempts designed to steal your personal and financial information. This can result in losing money, compromising your data, or receiving inferior goods, turning what should be a savvy shopping experience into a costly mistake.

3.  **Deals Might Not Be As Good As They Seem:**
    *   **Inflated Original Prices:** Retailers sometimes inflate original prices to make discounts appear more significant than they truly are. Without thorough research, you might think you're getting a huge deal when, in reality, the price isn't much lower (or even higher) than usual.
    *   **Lack of Exclusivity:** The ""exclusive deals"" touted might not be as unique as advertised. The same product could be available at a lower price at a different time of year or from another retailer.
    *   **Better Alternatives Exist:** Other sales events like Black Friday, post-holiday sales, or random flash sales throughout the year might offer better deals, especially for specific types of items. Rushing into a Cyber Monday purchase could mean missing out on a superior deal later.

4.  **Technological Issues Leading to Frustration and Potential Losses:** Websites crashing, slowing down, or failing to process transactions are common during high-traffic periods. This can mean losing out on a desired deal just as you're about to complete a purchase, or worse, facing security concerns like double-charging on interrupted transactions. While not always a direct financial loss, it can lead to buying the item at a higher price later.

5.  **Potential Delays and Inconvenience:** The massive volume of orders can lead to significant shipping delays or items being back-ordered. This can be particularly frustrating if you're buying gifts for the holidays, as items might not arrive on time. Overwhelmed customer service lines can also leave you with little recourse, causing additional stress and inconvenience, and potentially leading to last-minute, higher-priced purchases elsewhere.

6.  **Ignoring Your Financial Situation and Needs:** If you don't assess your current finances, set a strict budget (and stick to it), or consider if the items you want are actually likely to be significantly discounted, you're setting yourself up for financial strain. If you prefer a more relaxed shopping experience or the items you need don't typically see big Cyber Monday drops, participating just for the sake of it might not be beneficial and could lead to unnecessary spending.

In essence, while the *potential* for savings is there, the document highlights that the risks of overspending, falling for scams, getting less-than-stellar deals, and facing frustrating logistical or technical issues make Cyber Monday a financially questionable decision for anyone who isn't a very disciplined and well-researched shopper."
"DOCUMENT:
In June 2021, the long debate over whether college athletes should get paid gained some momentum as the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) passed its name, image, and likeness (NIL) policy, which enables student-athletes to be compensated for their names, images, and likenesses. This policy, which permitted athletes to pursue commercials, social media endorsements, and merchandise, for starters, served as a game changer for UC San Diego athletes by giving them opportunities to earn income while still maintaining their amateur status.
 

 UCSD second-year basketball player and Sixth College Public Health major Francis Nwaokorie is all for it. “I think it’s really good to allow athletes to build their brand up at such a young age and potentially provide for their families in the future,” Nwaokorie said.
 

 While Nwaokorie did not consider NIL deals during his freshman year when the NIL policy was new to collegiate athletics, he is starting to look more into NIL deals this year.
 

 “Coming in as a freshman last year, I had a lot of offers for NIL deals, but I was really focused on the season and trying to make sure I got playing time and didn’t want to get distracted with that stuff at that time,” Nwaokorie said. “Now, as a sophomore, I’m starting to look more into that stuff now that I am more experienced.”
 

 Second-year soccer player Andrew Valverde, a Sixth College Political Science major, transferred from UCLA to UCSD after his freshman season and believes that soccer is one of the sports that lacks the attention that some other high-profile sports like football and basketball receive. Football and basketball receive the most compensation in the NIL market, leaving other sports far behind.
 

 However, Valverde has been able to sign multiple NIL deals.
 

 “I have had the luck to secure great deals with great sponsors. I was a student-athlete ambassador for a soccer clothing brand called CRKSOLY., and they gave me opportunities to showcase myself and their brand,” Valverde said. “I also have been able to get a sponsorship through a trainer and have access to get free training.”
 

 Valverde mentioned the continued struggle most athletes face to find a NIL deal.
 

 “I do wish UCSD makes sponsorships more available for all its athletes and maybe more training so athletes know what they are getting into,” Valverde said. “Basketball and soccer may be [some] of the more high profile sports on the NCAA stage but for some sports, the opportunity to maximize their NIL may be tied to their respective schools.”
 

 According to Jeff Tourial, UCSD’s Associate Athletic Director, the resources are there for students.
 

 “We have created a portal on our website that answers many questions our scholar-athletes may have. In addition, our compliance staff has created a dedicated email address to further provide one-on-one guidance as needed. The Big West partnered with Compass in 2021 to provide a portal assisting SA [student-athletes] in deals,” Tourial stated.
 

 Though UCSD’s location in San Diego can mean that there are plenty of opportunities for student-athletes to capitalize on, UCSD’s conference affiliation limits its national exposure to a tier below other schools in the Pac-12 conference such as UCLA, USC, and UC Berkeley — schools that are more known for their athletics and can spend more on athletics, draw in better athletes, and bring more recognition toward their athletes in terms of media exposure. While this does not necessarily mean the NIL opportunities are not there, UCSD student-athletes may have a harder time signing more lucrative NIL deals compared to student-athletes from other schools.
 

 “I know a few people on other teams who have made deals with Liquid IV,” UCSD fourth-year water polo player and Eleanor Roosevelt College (ERC) Business Psychology major Kayla Peacock said. “They mostly get merchandise and products, depending on the company.”
 

 According to Peacock, there is some frustration regarding the NIL deals’ ambiguous criteria. NIL deals’ criteria states that athletes still have to adhere to school policies and state laws.
 

 “My only criticism of NIL is that we were trying to get our team to be sponsored by Crocs and they sent us a discount code and we weren’t allowed to use it. I don’t really understand why. So my complaint is that the rules are unclear for us as scholar-athletes,” Peacock said.
 

 NIL opportunities are not available for every student-athlete. For Derek Rong, they are nonexistent. Rong, a first-year ERC Business Economics major, is from Canada and is living in the U.S. on a student visa. Although the visa permits Rong to work on campus, the visa stipulates that he cannot work for a business outside of his college.
 

 “I think international students should be able to have the same opportunities,“ stated Rong, who is a fencer. “It’s more about the athlete’s performance and influence. I don’t have any deals, but I would love to explore them.“
 

 This might be the start of a push for more rights for college athletes in California. A bill in the formative stages could see student-athletes earn a share of the revenue tied to graduation. Essentially, athletes could make up a maximum of $25,000 per year and excess money would be placed in a fund that they can access if they graduate within six years. With Division I athletics raking in $15.8 billion in revenue, there is still a lot of money left at the table.
 

 “Certainly, I feel like that [increased rights for college athletes] can really help student-athletes who aren’t in the best situation income-wise at home and also help student-athletes pay for more things they need like airfare/transportation back home or even just to have extra money just in case of an emergency,” Nwaokorie said.

USER REQUEST:
If I have an athletic scholarship and attending a U.S. College with a Visa, can I get an NIL? Use a real life example from someone explaining a legal situation as I do not want to try to comprehend too much jargon.","NIL opportunities are not available for every student-athlete, including those on a student visa from another country. For example, Derek Rong, a first-year ERC Business Economics major from Canada living in the U.S. on a student visa, stated that while his visa permits him to work on campus, it ""stipulates that he cannot work for a business outside of his college"" (DOCUMENT). This means that for Derek Rong, NIL opportunities are nonexistent, as he cannot work for a business outside of his college (DOCUMENT).","That's a really good question, and the document sheds some light on a common hurdle for international student-athletes hoping to secure Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) deals.

Based on the information, if you have an athletic scholarship and are attending a U.S. college on a student visa, **you generally cannot get an NIL deal.**

The document gives a clear, real-life example of this with **Derek Rong**, a fencer and first-year Business Economics major at UC San Diego. Derek is from Canada and is living in the U.S. on a student visa. He explains his situation by stating:

""Although the visa permits Rong to work on campus, **the visa stipulates that he cannot work for a business outside of his college.**""

Essentially, NIL opportunities are ""nonexistent"" for him because his student visa restricts him from working for any business that isn't directly affiliated with his college. This means he can't sign endorsement deals with outside companies, even if he wanted to. Derek himself voices frustration over this, saying, ""I think international students should be able to have the same opportunities.""

So, while the NCAA's NIL policy has opened doors for many student-athletes, the current U.S. visa regulations create a significant barrier for international students like Derek, preventing them from benefiting from these opportunities."

context block: Notification Requirements.—The Committee reminds the Department that the Committee uses the definitions for transfer, reprogramming, and program, project, and activity as defined by the 
Government Accountability Office (GAO). As noted in the fiscal 
year 2023 Joint Explanatory Statement, a program, project, or activity (PPA) is an element within a budget account. PPAs are identified by reference to include the most specific level of budget items 
identified in the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug 
Administration, and Related Agencies Act, 2023, accompanying 
Committee reports, explanatory statements, and budget justifications. The Committee notes that the most specific level of budget 
items in USDA budget justifications is not limited to tables titled 
‘‘Project Statement’’. 
PFAS.—The Committee notes that there are previously provided 
funds related to polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) which remain 
available. The Committee remains concerned that there are significant knowledge gaps related to PFAS and its impact on agriculture. Therefore, the Committee awaits a plan from USDA and 
will continue to monitor PFAS. 
Resilient Building Materials.—With increases in weather-related 
and other natural disasters, there is a clear need to increase resilience of the nation’s buildings and infrastructure. Mass timber and 
other innovative wood products, when appropriately used in the 
construction of buildings and other infrastructure, have been 
shown to withstand wind, seismic, and other natural forces with robust results. The Committee acknowledges the need to include 
these products in any categorization of products considered to be 
resilient by USDA and other Federal agencies. The Committee, 
therefore, encourages USDA to support programs that include the 
use of wood products to improve the nation’s ability to withstand 
and recover from weather-related and other natural events. 
Rural Healthcare.—The Committee is encouraged by the opportunities to address nutrition security and rural healthcare across the 
Department and urges the Department to integrate strategic outcomes from recent summits across Rural Development, Food and 
Nutrition Services, Agricultural Marketing Service to provide technical assistance and guidance with respect to these outcomes to the 
Department’s outreach, extension, and county offices, particularly 
in communities that lack application experience or healthcare facilities. 
Simplified USDA Applications.—USDA customers are overburdened with complex program applications, contracts, and reporting. 
The Committee requests a report from USDA describing the barriers to simplifying program applications, contracts, and reporting. 
The report should also include any plans USDA has to simplify 
these documents and procedures. 
Spending Plans.—The bill continues a provision in Title VII that 
requires USDA to submit spending plans to the Committee within 
30 days of enactment. Previous versions of these plans have not included adequate details that would be useful for Committee overVerDate Sep 11 2014 22:55 Jun 28, 2023 Jkt 052642 PO 00000 Frm 00007 Fmt 6659 Sfmt 6602 E:\HR\OC\HR124.XXX HR124

sight. The Committee requests that USDA spending plans include 
for each program, project, or activity: (1) a comparison between the 
budget justification funding levels, the most recent Congressional 
directives or approved funding levels, and the funding levels proposed by the department or agency; and (2) a clear, concise, and 
informative description/justification. The Committee reminds 
USDA of notification requirements, also included in Title VII, for 
all applicable changes. 
Status of House and Senate Report Language.—The Department 
is directed to include in its fiscal year 2025 Congressional Justification, as a single exhibit, a table listing all deliverables, with a column for due dates if applicable. OBPA is directed to provide updates on the status of House and Senate reports upon request from 
the Committees. 
Underserved Producers Program.—The Committee is concerned 
about the Department’s reckless implementation of Section 22007 
of the Inflation Reduction Act through nongovernmental entities 
who undergo no formal application process to aid farmers, ranchers, and foresters who have experienced discrimination in FSA 
lending programs. The Committee notes that the precursor to this 
provision, Section 1005 of the American Rescue Plan Act, which 
provided loan forgiveness for socially disadvantaged farmers and 
ranchers, was struck down in court on equal protection grounds. 
The Committee reminds the Department that U.S. courts have held 
that significant participation by the Federal government in nongovernmental entities’ unconstitutional actions may be a violation 
of the Fourteenth Amendment. As the Department provides nongovernmental entities with entirely Federal funds, the Committee 
will closely monitor the Department’s use and involvement in the 
administration of the Section 22007 funds. 
USDA Domestic and International Commodity Procurement Review.—The COVID–19 pandemic and resulting supply chain disruptions revealed fragilities in America’s food supply, to the detriment of farmers, producers, and consumers across America. The 
Committee directs AMS and ERS to review USDA’s application and 
enrollment procedures, required commodity quality, best and most 
available commodities for purchase regionally, and outreach practices to small and local farmers for all available domestic and international USDA procurement programs. This will help increase understanding of programs and purchasing to elevate fair participation of America’s small and local farmers. Within 180 days of enactment of this Act, AMS and ERS shall report back on their findings and efforts on improving small and local farmer procurement 
for relevant USDA programs. 
USDA Farm Delivery Systems Modernization.—The Committee 
includes language that requires the Secretary to submit a plan to 
accelerate the implementation and use of the Farmers.gov application and the Enterprise Data Analytics Platform and Toolset 
(EDAPT). The Committee is aware that despite continued direction 
and funding provided by Congress, the Farm Service Agency, the 
Farm Production and Conservation Business Center, and the Office 
of the Chief Information Officer continue to maintain numerous 
legacy mission support systems that should be decommissioned and 
transitioned to applications that are interoperable, facts-based, 
data driven, and provide excellent customer service.

question: What actions are suggested to increase understanding of the USDA program?","To increase understanding of USDA programs, the Committee directs the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) and the Economic Research Service (ERS) to review USDA’s application and enrollment procedures, required commodity quality, best and most available commodities for purchase regionally, and outreach practices to small and local farmers for all available domestic and international USDA procurement programs (USDA Domestic and International Commodity Procurement Review).","To increase understanding of USDA programs, several actions are suggested or implied in the document:

1.  **Simplify USDA Applications and Procedures:** The Committee notes that ""USDA customers are overburdened with complex program applications, contracts, and reporting."" They request a report from USDA detailing barriers to simplification and outlining plans to make these documents and procedures easier to understand and use. This directly addresses the complexity that hinders understanding.

2.  **Review and Improve Commodity Procurement Practices:** For domestic and international commodity procurement programs, the Committee directs the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) and the Economic Research Service (ERS) to:
    *   Review USDA’s application and enrollment procedures.
    *   Assess required commodity quality.
    *   Identify the best and most available commodities for purchase regionally.
    *   Examine outreach practices to small and local farmers.
    The explicit goal of this review is to ""help increase understanding of programs and purchasing to elevate fair participation of America’s small and local farmers.""

3.  **Provide Technical Assistance and Guidance for Rural Healthcare:** The Committee encourages the Department to integrate strategic outcomes from recent summits related to nutrition security and rural healthcare. They urge USDA to provide ""technical assistance and guidance"" with respect to these outcomes to its outreach, extension, and county offices, particularly in communities that lack application experience or healthcare facilities. This support can help communities better understand and access relevant programs.

4.  **Modernize Farm Delivery Systems:** The Committee pushes for accelerating the implementation and use of the **Farmers.gov** application and the **Enterprise Data Analytics Platform and Toolset (EDAPT)**. By decommissioning outdated legacy systems and transitioning to interoperable, facts-based, data-driven applications that provide excellent customer service, the USDA can make program information and access much clearer and more efficient for farmers, thereby enhancing understanding.

In essence, the suggestions aim to reduce complexity, improve outreach and support, and modernize digital platforms to make USDA programs more accessible and understandable for farmers, producers, and rural communities."

Bitcoin's recent price movements have caused concern among investors about what might come next. However, by looking at key indicators such as the 200-week moving average, Pi Cycle Top Indicator, and the Golden Ratio Multiplier, we can gain insights into potential support and resistance levels for Bitcoin.
 

 Leaning Bearish?
 If this bearish price action is to continue and price breaks to lower lows the 200-week moving average heatmap (blue line), a historically critical support level, is currently close to $39,000 but fast approaching $40,000 (white line). This round psychological level also aligns with the Bitcoin Investor Tool (green line), which has also converged with the 200-week moving average, could serve as potential downside targets.
 

 Figure 1: Converging levels of support at $40,000 if bearish price action continues.
 Figure 1: Converging levels of support at $40,000 if bearish price action continues.
 

 Nearby Targets
 

 Above current price there are several important levels closer to the current price that investors need to keep an eye on. The Pi Cycle Top Indicator (upper orange line) suggests a crucial resistance level around $62,000, based on the 111-day moving average. The Golden Ratio Multiplier (lower orange line) indicates that the 350-day moving average, currently around $53,000, has been a solid level of support during this market cycle, especially as this is close to the technical $52,000 support and significant psychological support of $50,000.

 Figure 2: Nearby support between $53,000 and $50,000, with immediate resistance between $60,000 and $62,000.
 

 More Chop?
 

 In the short term, Bitcoin could very well continue ranging between the low $50,000 region and the $60,000 resistance, similar to the range we had formed between $70,000 and $60,000 that led to fairly stagnant price action for a majority of 2024. Despite recent downturns, Bitcoin's long-term outlook is still promising. In the past, Bitcoin has experienced similar periods of fluctuating prices before eventually reaching new highs. However, this process can take some time, potentially weeks or even months, before a sustainable trend reversal occurs following periods of low volatility.
 

 

 Conclusion
 For long-term investors, it's important to remain calm and not be swayed by day-to-day price changes. Over-trading often leads to poor decisions and losses, and the key is to stick to a strategy, whether it involves accumulating at support levels or taking profits at resistance.
 

 

 Bitcoin's recent price action has not been ideal, but with some simple technical analysis and a clear understanding of support and resistance levels, investors can prepare and react rather than over overreact to natural market fluctuations.
 

 While investing in Bitcoin is still considered a wild ride, the asset is quickly maturing. Financial institutions are closing in and creating hybrid vehicles to invest in cryptocurrency. The ecosystem reached a new milestone with the advent of Bitcoin ETFs, making people realize the immensity of Bitcoin’s potential in traditional markets and spurring new demand.
 

 It is not enough to leave the knowledge to technical experts or institutions. By understanding the importance of secure Bitcoin storage and the advancements in custody solutions, investors can make better-informed decisions about safeguarding their digital assets.

What do you expect of Bitcoin in the near future? Will it grow or diminish? Make your response thorough and no less than 150 words?","In the near future, Bitcoin could continue to range rather than exhibit a clear growth or diminution trend.

This is noted as similar to a previous range between $70,000 and $60,000 that resulted in ""fairly stagnant price action for a majority of 2024"" (More Chop?).

Specific indicators suggest certain levels for this range. The Pi Cycle Top Indicator suggests a ""crucial resistance level around $62,000,"" based on the 111-day moving average (Nearby Targets). The Golden Ratio Multiplier indicates that the 350-day moving average, which is ""currently around $53,000,"" has provided solid support in the current market cycle (Nearby Targets).

Therefore, immediate resistance is identified between $60,000 and $62,000, with nearby support between $53,000 and $50,000 (Figure 2).

However, if ""bearish price action is to continue and price breaks to lower lows,"" potential downside targets are also identified (Leaning Bearish?). The 200-week moving average heatmap, considered a historically critical support level, is ""currently close to $39,000 but fast approaching $40,000"" (Leaning Bearish?). This $40,000 psychological level also aligns with the Bitcoin Investor Tool and could serve as a potential downside target (Leaning Bearish?, Figure 1). A sustainable trend reversal following periods of low volatility might take ""weeks or even months"" (More Chop?).","Based on the recent analysis, Bitcoin's near future seems to be characterized by a period of **""chop"" or consolidation**, rather than an immediate clear direction of significant growth or sharp diminishing. The document suggests that Bitcoin could very well continue ranging between the low $50,000 region and the $60,000 resistance for some time, potentially weeks or even months.

If we look at potential **downside (diminishing)**, key indicators point to strong support around the **$39,000 to $40,000** mark. This crucial level is where the 200-week moving average heatmap, a historically critical support, converges with a significant psychological round number and the Bitcoin Investor Tool. If current bearish price action continues, this area would be the primary target for potential lower lows.

Conversely, for potential **growth**, there are several resistance levels to watch. The Pi Cycle Top Indicator suggests crucial resistance around **$62,000**. Closer to current prices, the Golden Ratio Multiplier indicates the 350-day moving average around **$53,000** has served as solid support, which also aligns with the technical $52,000 and psychological $50,000 support. This suggests that while there's a floor around $50,000-$53,000, breaking through $60,000-$62,000 would be a challenge for upward momentum.

So, in the near term, it's less about a dramatic growth spurt or a collapse, and more about navigating a defined range. However, it's important to remember that the **long-term outlook for Bitcoin is still described as promising**. The asset is maturing, with new developments like Bitcoin ETFs bringing in traditional market demand. While the short-term might see fluctuating prices and periods of low volatility, historical patterns suggest that Bitcoin often experiences such phases before eventually reaching new highs. For investors, the advice is to remain calm and stick to a strategy, rather than overreacting to daily price movements."

State v. Motta
 659 P.2d 745 (1983)
 On April 29, 1980 at about 11:30 p.m., Wendy Iwashita, a cashier on duty at Anna Miller's Coffee House in Pearlridge, was robbed at gunpoint by a man who demanded that she give him all the money she had in her cash register. Iwashita complied and the robber fled with approximately $300.00 in cash.
 

 Iwashita gave a description of the robber to the police who arrived at the scene soon thereafter. On May 6, 1980, Iwashita met with Joe Aragon, an artist for the Honolulu Police Department, who drew a composite sketch of the robbery suspect based on Iwashita's description.
 

 On June 3, 1980, Iwashita picked appellant's photograph from a photographic array of about twenty-five to thirty pictures. On June 9, 1980, Iwashita positively identified appellant in a preliminary hearing. At trial, Iwashita confirmed her prior identifications and pointed out the appellant as the person who robbed her.
 

 Appellant presented an alibi defense at trial. Appellant testified that he was at a nightclub at the time of the robbery. Appellant called several other witnesses to describe his physical appearance on the date of the robbery and to corroborate his alibi.
 

 After considering the evidence presented, the jury found appellant guilty of the offense of robbery in the first degree.
 ...
 Appellant also contends that the trial court erred in admitting Aragon's composite sketch based on Iwashita's description of the robbery suspect. Appellant argues that the sketch was inadmissible hearsay under Haw.R.Evid. 802 which provides that ""[h]earsay is not admissible except as provided by these rules, or by other rules prescribed by the Hawaii supreme court, or by statute."" Rule 801(3) defines ""hearsay"" as ""a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.""
 

 Other courts have admitted composite sketches into evidence under various rationales. One view, expressed by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in United States v. Moskowitz, 581 F.2d 14 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 871, 99 S. Ct. 204, 58 L. Ed. 2d 184 (1978), is that a police sketch is not even hearsay because it does not qualify as a statement which is defined in Fed.R.Evid. 801(a) as ""(1) an oral or written assertion or (2) nonverbal conduct of a person, if it is intended by him as an assertion."" Under this view, since the sketch did not constitute hearsay, it merely had to satisfy the authentication requirements of Fed.R.Evid. 901.
 

 *750 Another approach taken by some state courts is to view the police sketch as hearsay, but admissible under various common-law hearsay exceptions. The Pennsylvania Superior Court in Commonwealth v. Dugan, 252 Pa.Super. 377, 381 A.2d 967 (1977) took this approach and found that a sketch made by a friend of the victim was properly admitted under the ""res gestae"" exception to the hearsay rule since the sketch had been made shortly after the victim had seen the suspect. The Illinois Supreme Court in People v. Rogers, 81 Ill. 2d 571, 44 Ill.Dec. 254, 411 N.E.2d 223 (1980) held that the hearsay rule did not bar admission of a composite sketch used as extra-judicial identification evidence to corroborate a witness' in-court identification.
 

 A final alternative, which is available to those courts which have adopted rules similar to the Federal Rules of Evidence, is to allow the admission of composite sketches and other pretrial identifications under the prior identification exception to the general hearsay exclusionary rule under Fed.R. Evid. 801(d)(1)(C). 
 ...
 After careful review of the various alternatives, we find that the better approach is to recognize a composite sketch as hearsay but nevertheless admissible under the hearsay exception for prior identifications if it complies with Haw.R.Evid. 802.1(3) (which is identical in substance to Fed. R.Evid. 801(d)(1)(C).[4]
 

 We recognize along with the majority of courts that a composite sketch is in fact hearsay. It has the same effect as if the victim had made a verbal description of the suspect's physical characteristics. Just because the sketch is in picture form does not change the fact that it is being offered as a statement made out of court to prove what the suspect looked like. See United States v. Moskowitz, 581 F.2d at 22 (Friendly, J., concurring); Commonwealth v. Dugan, 381 A.2d at 971 (Spaeth, J., concurring).
 

 Although a composite sketch is hearsay, it may still be admissible as a prior identification under Haw.R.Evid. 802.1(3) if (1) the declarant testifies at trial and is subject to cross-examination concerning the subject matter of his statement and (2) the *751 statement is one of identification of a person made after perceiving him. In the instant action, the admission of the sketch met the requirements of Haw.R.Evid. 802.1(3): the declarant, Wendy Iwashita, testified at trial and was available for cross-examination regarding the subject matter of her description, and the sketch was an identification of the robbery suspect made after Iwashita had seen him.
 

 Appellant contends that the composite sketch was admitted solely to corroborate Wendy Iwashita's in-court identification. Appellant consequently argues that since corroborating evidence is only admissible when offered to rebut testimony impeaching the witness and no such impeaching evidence was introduced, the sketch is inadmissible.
 

 Appellant misapprehends the nature of the prior identification exception to the hearsay rule. Unlike the common-law extrajudicial identification exception involved in People v. Rogers, supra, the prior identification exception under Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(1)(C) (and under Haw.R.Evid. 802.1(3)) allows the admission of pretrial identifications, not merely as corroborative evidence, but also as substantive proof of identity. See Haw.R.Evid. 802.1 commentary (""The substantive use of prior identifications is allowed in Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(1)(C)""); 11 J. Moore, supra § 801.41[5] (""[S]tatutory construction requires that the same substantive effect be given to a prior statement that qualifies under (C) as a prior statement qualifying under (A) or (B) of the same paragraph""). See also Gilbert v. California, 388 U.S. 263, 272, n. 3, 87 S. Ct. 1951, 1956, n. 3, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1178 (1967) (""The recent trend... is to admit the prior identification under the exception that admits as substantive evidence a prior communication by a witness who is available for cross-examination at trial"").
 

 Thus, as one commentator notes, Rule 801(d)(1)(C) operates independently of the impeachment process and therefore the statement is admissible as substantive evidence even though it is not a prior inconsistent statement for impeachment purposes as required in Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(1)(A) nor a prior consistent statement for rehabilitation purposes as required in Rule 801(d)(1)(B).
 The primary reason for excluding hearsay is the danger that the declarant is not available and her credibility therefore cannot be assessed by the trier of fact. That danger was not present in this case where both Joe Aragon, the police artist who made the sketch, and Wendy Iwashita, the eyewitness who provided the description, testified at trial and were subject to cross-examination by the defense. See also State v. Naeole, 62 Haw., (testimony permitted with regard to photographic lineup where both the officer who conducted the lineup and the person making the identification were present at trial to testify about the prior identification and were subject to cross-examination.
 Given the fact that the jury was given the opportunity to judge the credibility of both the police artist and the eyewitness at trial, we find no reason to disturb the trial court's discretion in admitting the sketch into evidence.

USER REQUEST:
I have been studying the jurisprudence of Hawaiian courts because I am really interested in their opinions. This case seems to be really relevant, as it was included in some casebooks. Please provide me with the case issue. Furthermore, explain why the portrait is hearsay, what was the portrait's finality, and then tell me why it was still admitted anyway. Do not use more than 250.","The case issue in *State v. Motta* was whether the trial court erred in admitting the composite sketch of the robbery suspect (State v. Motta, 659 P.2d 745, 749 (1983)).

The court recognized the composite sketch as hearsay because it functions ""as if the victim had made a verbal description of the suspect's physical characteristics"" and was ""offered as a statement made out of court to prove what the suspect looked like"" (State v. Motta, 659 P.2d 745, 750 (1983)).

The portrait's finality, or purpose, was to serve not merely as corroborative evidence, but as ""substantive proof of identity"" under Haw.R.Evid. 802.1(3) (State v. Motta, 659 P.2d 745, 751 (1983)).

Despite being hearsay, the sketch was admitted under the prior identification exception found in Haw.R.Evid. 802.1(3). This was permissible because the declarant, Wendy Iwashita, testified at trial and was subject to cross-examination, and the sketch itself was an identification of the robbery suspect made after Iwashita had seen him (State v. Motta, 659 P.2d 745, 750-751 (1983)).","That's an excellent case to study for Hawaiian jurisprudence, as it clarified important evidentiary rules! Here's a breakdown of *State v. Motta*:

The main **case issue** was whether a police composite sketch, drawn from an eyewitness's description, was admissible evidence, specifically whether it was inadmissible hearsay.

The court determined the portrait was **hearsay** because it served as an out-of-court statement (a visual depiction) offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted—what the robber looked like. Just like a verbal description made outside court, a sketch offered for the same purpose falls under the definition of hearsay.

The sketch's **finality** (its purpose for admission) was not merely to corroborate the eyewitness's in-court identification, but crucially, it was admitted as **substantive proof of identity**. This meant the sketch itself could be considered by the jury as direct evidence of who the robber was.

Despite being hearsay, the sketch was **still admitted anyway** under a specific exception for prior identifications, found in Hawaii Rule of Evidence 802.1(3) (similar to federal rules). It qualified because the eyewitness (Wendy Iwashita) testified at trial and was available for cross-examination regarding her description, and the sketch was an identification she made after perceiving the robber. The availability of both the eyewitness and the artist for cross-examination ensured the jury could assess their credibility."

Abstract
Australia’s Federal Government announced the National Broadband Network (NBN) in 2009. NBN’s current roll-out is scheduled for completion in 2021, with market forecasts estimating optical fibre overtaking DSL broadband connections in about 2015. This paper provides a timely contribution to more critical and expansive analysis of potential Australian internet futures. First, ‘schools of thought’ and current technological frames (Web 2.0, ‘the cloud’) for the internet and its possible futures are outlined, which provide perspectives on the emergence of the NBN. We then outline five generic images of the future which, as predetermined images, enable quick ‘incasting’ of alternative futures for a technology topic or related object of research: promised future, social/ speculative bubble(s), unfolding disruption/chaos, unintended consequences, and co-existence/‘cooption’. High-level application of the ‘schools’ and generic images to the NBN and Australia’s potential internet futures, suggests policymakers and strategists currently consider too few perspectives. 
Keywords: national broadband network, internet, incasting, technology foresight, Australia

Introduction 
Analyses of internet futures often outline prevailing trends – such as the shift towards mobile internet and personal/business data capture and analysis – and project major, positive, rapid changes to business, politics and daily life. However, trends constantly evolve and can change dramatically, rendering earlier forecasts obsolete. ‘Virtual worlds’ like Second Life were touted as innovations that would rapidly alter online business and marketing – only interest waned and shifted to educational uses (Salomon, 2010). Conversely, popular social networks like Twitter were initially dismissed – only to rapidly become mainstream, due in part to celebrity uptake (Burns and Eltham, 2009). This article develops an alternative approach to technology foresight, and on prospective thinking about Australia’s internet futures. Analyses are reframe-able expressions of one of many ‘schools of thought’ or mental models on internet futures. We suggest a shift in focus towards alternative futures, and the theoretical and analytical perspectives can inform this analysis. We use a mixed-method approach to consider potential internet futures, identify generic categories of future images, and consider these for ‘incasting’ a focal topic thereby deductively conceptualising alternative futures (Dator, 2002). This article’s core aims are: (1), to present an outline of key ‘schools of thought’ and theoretical perspectives on technological change which informs a new technology futures framework; and, (2), to show how this framework could be used to quickly conceptualise possible futures, in particular, Australia’s potential internet futures. The article also addresses the need to move beyond the dualistic discussion of internet futures as either emancipatory or, alternatively, dystopian. We need to better recognise and consider the diverse mixture of positive and negative outcomes the internet will more plausibly be associated with. As Voros observed, “we can – if we are wise enough – choose the quality of our mental models and guiding images of the future and, therefore, the quality of the decisions we make based upon them” (Voros, 2006). We agree: such ‘guiding images’ are too often taken-for-granted. The paper is structured as follows. We first outline recent perspectives on internet futures. A review of relevant visions and technological change theory is synthesised as a new technological futures framework. Through ‘incasting’ we use this framework to consider the potential for alternative internet futures to emerge in Australia, focusing on the National Broadband Network (NBN) and the 2020 outlook.
Current Schools of Thought and Technological Frames
Schools of thought
 The Smart Internet Technology CRC’s report Smart Internet 2010 articulated four schools of thought about possible internet futures (Barr, Burns, & Sharp, 2005). The four ‘schools’ were Rich Media, Adaptive User Environments, Not the Smart Internet and Chaos Rules. Each school encompassed an image of the future, theoretical perspectives, and thought leaders. Each school “ought to be viewed as… shared mindsets” which “suggest possible future outcomes” (Barr, Burns, & Sharp, 2005, p.7). Rich Media was the default future: the “multi-person, multi-device” access envisioned by Microsoft, News Corporation, Nokia and other corporations. This view anticipated debates about Australia’s development of the NBN; rural-based tele-medicine infrastructure; consumer booms in high-definition television, and the Australian Government’s Digital Education Revolution. This ‘school’ is “closely related to … advocates of the pervasive computing approach” (Barr, Burns, & Sharp, 2005, p.41). Adaptive User Environments emphasised end-user experience, adaptability, and design, like Apple’s iPod, iPhone and iPad, and how “social and cultural factors influence the way end users and consumers interact with a wide range of Internet-based technologies and services” (Barr, Burns, & Sharp, 2005, p.24). Not the Smart Internet emphasised “basic services for all” and “open standards”. Chaos Rules was pessimistic and slightly dystopian, questioning the robustness of Internet services (e.g. due to hackers, viruses, and cyber-warfare) and over-reliance on information technology. This school anticipated concerns about digital technologies and social media impacts on brain function, attention spans and society (Watson, 2010). Chaos Rules also foreshadowed Taleb’s (2007) contrarian thinking on low-probability, high-impact ‘Black Swan’ events.
Today’s dominant frames: ‘Web 2.0’, ‘Web 3.0’, and ‘the Cloud’
A technological frame structures interactions among relevant social groups via the set of meanings attached to a technology/artifact (Bjiker, 1995). Publisher Tim O’Reilly’s (2005) Web 2.0 is currently the dominant internet frame. After the 2000 dotcom crash, most internet companies struggled to raise finance and survive. Dotcom era visions such as convergence and disintermediation seemed dead. O’Reilly’s Web 2.0 contended the next generation of web tools would be more accessible and end-user friendly, and be associated with collective intelligence, participation, and service delivery. This coincided with Google’s initial public offering and the emergence of social networks like Facebook. The frame also co-opted the UK Blair Government’s promotion of creative industries and the maturation of knowledge management (Leadbeater, 2009; Tapscott & Williams, 2010). Web 2.0 shapes current policy agendas such as ‘Government 2.0’ and ‘e-Health’. Thought leaders now increasingly discuss Web 3.0 which Web 2.0 might evolve into. Web 3.0 might include the mainstreaming of sophisticated, mobile internet connected devices, greater video content, ‘cloud’ computing, ‘the internet of things’ (physical objects are also connected to the internet such as cars, home appliances, buildings), and a broader convergence of digital and physical worlds. Kevin Kelly (2011) defines this frame with six verbs: screening (not reading), interacting (“if it’s not interacting, it doesn’t work”), sharing, flowing, accessing, and generating. An emerging theme is collecting and using personal data. Data is ‘the new oil’: offering a new wave of value creation potential “in a world where nearly everyone and everything are connected in real time”, despite privacy and trust concerns (World Economic Forum, 2011, p.5). The end-user remains central and is part of wider ‘data ecosystems’ which can be ‘mined’ to deliver more personalised services. Information and communication technology (ICT) will be a ubiquitous, intrinsic part of all social behaviours, business practices and government (Greenhill, 2011). The ‘cloud’ – a metaphor for resources accessible on-demand (e.g. software, content) from anywhere via remote internet accessible storage – and associated ‘cloud computing’ models is a front-runner for such as paradigm shift. The ‘cloud’ and ‘internet of things’ relate to emerging agendas for ‘smart’ and ‘embedded’ systems. Through ‘intelligent’ infrastructure and devices, data gathering and management will become infused into service delivery and everyday objects. IBM’s former chief executive officer Samuel Palmisano (2008; 2010) believes computing power will be “delivered in forms so small, abundant and inexpensive” that it is “put into things no one would recognize as computers: cars, appliances, roadways and rail lines, power grids, clothes; across processes and global supply chains; and even in natural systems, such as agriculture and waterways.” Further, ‘systems of systems’ will turn a mass of data into information and insight, to enable smarter healthcare, more efficient energy systems and productivity improvements (Palmisano, 2010; RuedaSabater & Garrity, 2011)
However, Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 are uncertain. Google, Facebook, Twitter, and Wikipedia have led to ‘lock-in’ and institutional capture of specific services. Paradoxically, this may limit future innovation. Disruptive challengers may emerge from China and India. Emerging internet communities in developing countries appear to adopt different attitudes and online behaviours which may become more influential (Dutta et al., 2011). A second view considers increasing user concerns about online privacy, identity theft, and changing public attitudes in Western markets. Dutta et al’s (2011, p.9) international user study also found users “want it all: they desire freedom of expression, privacy, trust, and security without viewing these as mutually exclusive.” However, trade-offs between these potentially conflicting priorities may in fact be necessary. We need to think about futures in which people, in effect, ‘trade’ aspects of their privacy in return for other benefits. A final view is that most Web 2.0/ Web3.0 firms are yet to develop sustainable business models beyond start-ups. These perspectives foreshadow alternative futures.
Considering Alternative Technological and Internet Potentials
In this section we outline five generic images for technological futures, based on a review of different perspectives (such as those described above), technological change theory, and innovation theory. This framework can be used to consider potential internet futures.
Promised future (Dominant expectation[s] and vision[s])
The first category is the simplest to describe and identify. ‘Promises’ are made by actors seeking to build support for particular domains – such as those made by thought leaders about ‘Web 3.0’, the ‘internet of things’, and social media. Theoretically, the Sociology of Expectations (SoE) informs this category (Borup et al., 2006; Brown et al., 2000). SoE scholars suggest that expectations of technologies and their impacts/ potential strongly influence the technological development and innovation, such as through ‘self-fulfilling prophecies’ (as seen with Moore’s Law). The more successful a particular ‘expectation’, i.e. the more support it has gained, the more likely key actors are to act in ways that help make it a future reality. Foresight analysts can proactively monitor this process and its outcomes. Shared expectations can play necessary, central roles in creating momentum and stimulating coordination of heterogeneous actors. The Australian Government’s National Broadband Network – discussed in Section 4 – and the European Commission’s new ‘Digital Agenda’ for Europe, illustrate this. Alternatively, they can be problematic if widely accepted expectations (such as the default Rich Media ‘school’ or Web 2.0) remain uncritically accepted. Further, a dominant vision may exclude other possible internet futures from being considered by business and government, just as a dominant ‘official future’ can limit thinking in organisations.
Social/Speculative bubble(s)
Bubbles refer to a “heightened state of speculative fervour” that emerges in markets which, ultimately, result in investment failures and drastic, sudden market corrections (Shiller, 2005). In technological change, ‘hype cycles’ are similarly quite common (Finn & Raskino, 2008). These are often due to over-promising by promotional actors who are seeking resources (Geels & Smit, 2000). Additionally, greater social focus on a dominant ‘frame’ can emerge as actors become ‘enrolled’ (Bijker, 1995). Some theorists see bubble creation as a natural, necessary part of major technological change. The innovation theory of social bubbles argues collective over-enthusiasm and commitments beyond what would be rationalised by cost benefit analyses, fuelled by hype, is necessary to enable action in the presence of risk and uncertainty (Gisler et al., 2011; Gisler & Sornette, 2009). Perez’s (2002; 2010) technological revolutions theory further contends that a recurring sequence of events occurs during each revolution, each time taking between 40-60 years: an initial ‘installation phase’ (e.g. investments in new supporting infrastructure) first, leading to speculative bubbles and a dramatic turning point, and followed a ‘deployment period’ heralding a new ‘golden age’. Similarly, Kondratieff-like ‘long waves’ are advanced (Freeman & Louca, 2001). Perez argues we are at the ‘turning point’ in the middle of the ICT revolution, during which major bubbles are expected. According to Perez, a ‘new age’ requires a new mode of growth compatible with a new ‘paradigm logic’ (for the revolution), and institutional changes to create the conditions for this growth. Web 2.0 has become the dominant ‘frame’ and recent investment growth illustrates this. Facebook had a more than four-fold increase in valuation as it prepared for an initial public offering (Ozanian, 2011). Microsoft purchased Skype for over 400 times its operating income (Anonymous, 2011). These dramatic changes create hype cycles (Finn & Raskino, 2008). Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg remarked (from a Rich Media worldview): “if you look five years out, every industry is going to be rethought in a social way” (cited in Gelles, 2010). Brands rushing into social media view it “as the panacea to diminishing returns in traditional mass media” (Fournier & Avery, 2011). However, concerns over privacy and how greater marketing and advertising might affect social networks may ‘pop’ such a bubble and herald major shifts. Web 2.0 may be a major speculative bubble like the 1995-2000 dotcom era (Hirschorn, 2007; Raznick, 2011; Vance, 2011; Wooldridge, 2010). As Hirschorn (2007) observed, “in the Web hype-o-sphere, things matter hugely until, very suddenly, they don’t matter at all”. He forecasts social media to be “only another in a long string of putatively disruptive, massively hyped technologies that prove just one more step in the long march.” The propensity of internet discourses to naïve prophetic thinking, self-styled experts and exaggerated promises (Dublin, 1991) partly explains regular shifts from hype to disappointment.
Disruption/Chaos
Schumpeterian ‘creative destruction’ – the emergence, experimentation and innovation central to technological change and free markets – largely defines this image. ‘Chaos’ can also mean opportunity (as well as the danger normally perceived). Services originally designed to ‘police’ social networks have also led to new innovations in text mining and complex event processing (Sommon & Brown, 2011). ‘Disruption’ can be technological or driven by additional social or political factors. For example, a common pitfall in expectations of future technological developments is believing social practices “to remain constant in spite of the introduction of new technology (Geels & Smit, 2000, p.880). Exponential growth in the miniaturisation of transistors and computer power (Moore’s Law) may no longer hold in coming decade(s) and dramatically change chip fabrication costs (Rupp & Selberherr, 2011). Natural resource limits may disrupt consumer markets: the scarcity of needed rare earth elements in which China controls 95% of global supply (Cohen, 2007). Additional emerging candidates for future disruption are ‘augmented reality’ technologies and ‘nano-electronics’. Early stage augmented reality prototypes and technologies are now being commercialised together with geo-location tools like Geoloqi.com, in which real-world environments are ‘augmented’ by sensory inputs received via technology (via smart phones). An alternative medium-term source of technological disruption is a major new means of chip fabrication and manufacturing. Most prevalent at present is ‘nano-electronics’, a major area of research in Australia and Asia-Pacific.
Unintended consequences
Unintended social consequences emerge from second-order and third-order effects of technologies along with the appropriation of technologies. Theorists show that technologies are often ‘appropriated’ by diverse end-user groups, typically for uses unforeseen by the technology creators (Burns & Eltham, 2009; Jamison & Hard, 2003). Cyberpunk author William Gibson similarly observed that “the street finds its own use for things.” This category reveals a wide range of internet potentials and perspectives. ‘Cyberrealism’ is an emerging Chaos Rules-like philosophy that challenges the often utopian internet discourses (Morozov, 2011). Further convergence of digital and physical/ social worlds will enable political and other interests to shape the digital world’s development and its use in unexpected ways (Kelly & Cook, 2011; Morozov, 2011). Recent literature suggests unintended consequences may include: information flows being distorted by personalisation features (Pariser, 2011); data security and privacy being compromised by the adoption of open/cloud computing architectures (Bisong & Rahman, 2011; Grobauer et al., 2011); authoritarian governments gaining power from the internet, rather than a power shift to individuals which is more commonly expected (Burns & Eltham, 2009; Morozov, 2011); and the potential for intensified consumerism as more sophisticated ways to advertise and sell become embedded in more online and social technologies. The “open platform paradigm” of Not the Smart Internet can also, paradoxically, compromise content creation and intellectual property (Lanier, 2010). The spectre of increasing cyber-warfare is a topical national security issue and regional flashpoint (Clarke & Nake, 2010). For example, China is blamed for attacks on the ICT systems of Australian mining and resource firms (Wilkinson, 2010). In the Asia-Pacific region, many countries have invested in new national teams and defensive cyber-warfare capabilities. Several different possibilities exist about how cyber-warfare could evolve. Attacks on transnational firms may impact the stability of sovereign financial markets. Countries may develop offensive cyber-warfare capabilities and teams as a form of market intelligence, and as strategies to gain access to intellectual property. 
Co-existence/Co-option
Co-existence/Co-option focusses on the complex ‘co-evolution’ of technology and society. This co-evolution makes unpredicted futures more likely than is commonly recognised despite our best efforts to achieve foresight (Williams, 2006). Through ‘coevolution’ one possibility is the complex co-existence of old and new technologies (Geels & Smit, 2000). This is an important counter-point to common forecasts in which the new replaces or displaces the old. Co-existence/Co-option also recognises 39 that business entrepreneurs and experts often articulate and promote futures they have a vested interest in. SoE scholars in the Science and Technologies Studies field emphasise attempts “to create ‘direction’ or convince others of ‘what the future will bring’” (Brown et al., 2000, p.4). Here, ‘contested futures’ is relevant. Brown et al (2000, p.3-4) observe that “if actors are to secure successfully for themselves a specific kind of future then they must engage in a range of rhetorical, organisational and material activities through which the future might be able to be ‘colonised’.” These actor strategies may also partly explain how Web 2.0 versions of Rich Media and Adaptive User Environments quickly came to dominate thinking. Web 2.0 growth and social networks provide emancipatory tools for many, yet have also enriched key individuals like Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, Mahalo’s Jason Calacanis, publishers John Battelle and Tim O’Reilly and LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman. However, the broader community of ‘Web 2.0’ proponents and consultants rarely consider the possibility that they may be acting on what Inayatullah (2008, p.5) terms “used futures”: out-dated conceptions of the future “unconsciously borrowed from someone else.” Additionally, the increasing number of proposals to ‘order’ or (re)structure the evolution of the internet and mobile markets is a clear manifestation of the ongoing ‘co-evolution’ of technology and society which continually plays out. These proposals include the ‘network neutrality’ debate, and United States legislation such as the Stop Online Piracy Act, and the Research Works Act that would restrict ‘open access’ publishing. These regulatory regimes can reshape industry trajectories and change the balance of power between innovators, early adopters and laggards (Lessig, 2001; Spar, 2001; Wu, 2010).
Case Study: Australia’s Potential Internet Futures
In this section we focus on the Australian context: the National Broadband Network (NBN) which is being rolled-out by the Federal Government. If it is fully rolled out (the Federal Opposition currently opposes this), the high speed network of three technologies (optic fibre, fixed wireless, satellite) will be completed in approximately 2020.1 We first introduce the NBN. Issues and potential futures are then discussed, considering the analytical perspectives advanced.
The national broadband network
An NBN was first proposed by Australia’s Howard Liberal Government in 2003 and eventually made a Federal election issue in 2007. The then Rudd Labor Government announced in April 2009 that it would form the NBN Co, a wholly-owned Commonwealth company, to build and operate a national “wholesale-only, open access broadband network.” The successor Gillard Labor Government started to roll-out in 2011. The Federal Government’s decision to create the new network followed almost a decade of unsuccessful attempts to build an NBN-like network. Sol Trujillo-era Telstra adopted lobbying tactics to delay the separation of its retail and wholesale divisions. Competitors like Optus lobbied against Telstra to avoid hidden network and sunk costs. A competitive bargaining game developed. Research and development firms like Telstra Research Labs and the Smart Internet Technology CRC led supply-side research on NBN-like application scenarios and use cases. The NBN was the Australian Government’s response to telecommunications market failures. The Smart Internet Technology CRC highlighted early-stage innovators and commercialisation possibilities. However, gaps in the Australian environment, such as the lack of a venture capital sector, hampered efforts. NBN Co’s formation shifted the debate to access and pricing regimes, location of testing sites, and the reaction of market incumbent Telstra. New debates also focus on government and capital markets execution. NBN Co faced scrutiny about its operational efficiencies (in 2011 the pricing regime was revealed to be more expensive than first planned), ability to roll-out the network, and the management team.
Analysis: Schools of thought and alternative futures
The default future in the ‘schools of thought’ framework is Rich Media. This ‘school’ may have captured Australian Government policy-making and academic research as the dominant technological frame that actors have been enrolled in (Bjiker, 1995). NBN evidences the role of shared expectations in creating sufficient momentum and stimulating coordination: all actors speak of the same “digital economy of the future” and of its emancipatory, economic potential. The NBN is a return to the 1990s rhetoric of the internet as an ‘information superhighway’ in a new guise. Similar claims to NBN’s emancipatory potential were made for Sausage Software during the Netscape-Microsoft browser wars (in the mid-late 1990s) and for local content production for the 2G and 3G mobile internet. The Not the Smart Internet ‘school’ would suggest an NBN framed as an important intervention that primarily addresses access and digital divide issues, and provides more widespread, functional, lower-cost, transparent services. However, this contrasts with Rich Media style focus on network speed and capacity for media streaming and future ‘cloud’ based businesses. The Adaptive User Environments ‘school’ suggests 41 emulating, locally, Apple or Google-like models of content creation and distribution. Australian retailers such as JB Hi-Fi might develop new online content serviceorientated models (e.g. streaming music services like Pandora). However, these firms must successfully compete with global competitors to win customers (Stafford, 2011). NBN may provide the infrastructure for virtual worlds to have more significant uptake (Salomon, 2010). The Chaos Rules ‘school’ suggests security capabilities to pre-empt hackers, viruses, and cyber-warfare. Alternative futures framework: Considering image categories In this section we provide a high-level ‘incast’ of Australian internet futures, considering a 2020 time horizon. Incasting involves considering predetermined images of the future in order to deduce alternative future scenarios for the particular object of the research (Del Pino, 1998). The advantage of this approach is that it enables quickly conceptualising alternative futures (Dator, 2002).
Promised future
 The ‘promises’ and dominant expectations for Australian internet futures are clearly expressed in the Government’s (2011) National Digital Economy Strategy (NDES) which articulates a vision for Australia to be, by 2020, a ‘world leading digital economy’. Eight goals are defined: • By 2020, Australia will rank in the top five OECD countries for the portion of households that connect to broadband at home; • By 2020, Australia will rank in the top five OECD countries for the portion of businesses and not-for-profit organisations using online opportunities; • By 2020, the majority of Australian households, businesses and other organisations will have access to smart technology to better manage their energy use; • Improved health and aged care: by 2020 90 per cent of high priority consumers (e.g. older Australians, those with a chronic disease) can access individual electronic health records; by 2015 495,000 telehealth consultations will have been delivered by remote specialists; by 2020, 25 per cent of all specialists will be participating in delivering telehealth consultations; • Expanded online education; • By 2020 at least doubling the level of teleworking (at least 12 per cent of Australian employees); • By 2020, four out of five Australians will choose to engage with the government through the internet or other type of online service; and • By 2020, the gap between households and businesses in capital cities and those in regional areas will have narrowed significantly. The NDES envisages a ‘market-led’ transition to this future economy, connecting activities to the ‘smart systems’ vision (e.g. using ICT to optimise energy and transportation systems) “enabled by... the internet, mobile and sensor networks” (p.12). A ‘linear’ view, similar to Rich Media and Adaptive User Environments, is adopted: “based on existing trends, in the future the online experience will become richer and more data intensive and increasingly integrated into everyday life, at home and at work” (p.10). Inclusions themes, of Not the Smart Internet, are also noted: “distance - once a defining characteristic and barrier for regional Australia - becomes increasingly Australia's Potential Internet Futures Journal of Futures Studies 42 irrelevant” (www.nbn.gov.au).
Social/Speculative bubble
The NBN and NDES were developed during intensifying Web 2.0/Web3.0 hype. An alternative image centres on the potential for unmet expectations, and the associated ‘fall-out’. This would replay aspects of the 1995-2000 dotcom bubble – especially if the current “state of speculative fervor” (Shiller, 2005) surrounding Web 2.0 contracts in the near-to-medium-term. The envisaged application scenarios and use cases may also not be commercially and/or socially viable. An important example is ‘e–health’ for aged Australians. Australia has to-date struggled to develop viable new e-health businesses/business models for providing aged care, and public acceptance issues could also slow adoption (Tegart, 2010). Similarly, teleworking has tended to not meet expectations (Geels & Smit, 2000) due to unmet social needs which could reoccur over the next decade. In this future, when 2020 arrives the economic productivity ‘promise’ of NBN is unrealised.2 Moreover, it raises the possibility – if user take-up is lower than expected, as recently occurred in the UK – of delays in NBN Co gaining sufficient cash-flow to no longer require government support. Some Australian social scientists have argued – in part due to highly differential take-up across NBN test sites – that the ‘promises’ (above) will be challenged by local cultural and material factors, and that such variations will grow in significance as the NBN is further rolled-out (Apperley et al., 2011). Both localised conditions (e.g. installation policy and logistics, costs) and “integration of the NBN with each household’s domestic network of hardware devices, internal connections, software, and of course skill and interest” must be considered (Apperley et al., 2011). Like the recent example of the Human Genome Project (Gisler et al., 2011) it may take many decades to fully “exploit the fruits” of the NBN investment, rather than the shorter time horizons presently expected.
Disruption/Chaos
This image highlights the ‘creative destruction’ associated with technological change and associated potential for unanticipated shifts in practices. If optical fibre overtakes DSL broadband connections after 2015/6 (assuming full roll-out continues)3 then many sectors are likely to be ‘ripe’ for disruption – such as media, telecommunications, advertising, and retail – as people invent ways to utilise the expansion in bandwidth and evolve offline behaviours. Implicit in the NBN is a vision of a “digital home” and “an anticipated future of digital living” (Apperley et al., 2011) which many may embrace, whilst others ‘opt-out’ of the “connectopia” (Kiss, 2011). Similarly, broadband services (see generic categories in Table 2), and the NBN, need to be viewed more broadly than as merely high-speed Internet.

By 2020, internet futures could have a majorly disruptive impact on several sectors. Today’s decline in newspapers and some retail sectors (e.g. music, books), could signal futures in which many local firms are unable to maintain viable, growing businesses. Local players such as those experimenting with new service-oriented models, such as JB Hi-Fi, increasingly face global competition and disruption potential. Regulators and users may also still be “struggling to work out the boundaries of online privacy” (Gettler, 2010) as practices, tools, and norms evolve.
Unintended consequences
NBN has the potential to generate a multitude of unintended social consequences – both positive and negative (often depending on whose perspective is taken). NBN uptake may vary by geographic areas, leading to new subtle versions of the ‘digital divide’. Related socio-technical factors influence access to participation in a digital economy. The ‘unintended consequences’ image also alludes to the potential for arbitrage and leaking of NBN data to individuals. Although the ‘Gov 2.0’ agenda views the open data movement positively, Australia is constrained by the Westminster system which presently imposes limits on the release of government data. Major unintended consequences for the Australian political system could emerge in a more technologically-empowered society – a potential blind-spot for politicians, regulators, policymakers, and others. The internet can also facilitate larger-scale manipulation of publics (Kearne, 2012), a concerning trend the NBN may also enable.
Co-existence/Co-option
In another plausible scenario a “patchwork of [variable] connectivity” prevents the envisaged future, centred on the digital home being “integrated into the digital economy as a node of production and consumption” (Apperley et al., 2011), from fully emerging. The ‘co-existence’/‘co-option’ image further suggests potential internet futures in which highly advanced digital homes co-exist with less advanced and connected homes with varying connections, mediums, and social conditions – rather than a homogenous new ‘digital Australia’. In this future official projections of 70 percent take-up by 2025 are not achieved. Political risks provide another avenue to such futures, with a partially complete NBN (if there is a change of Federal government) likely co-existing with Australia's Potential Internet Futures Journal of Futures Studies 44 other networks. Additionally, a range of social, competitive, and regulatory issues highlight the potential for ‘co-option’. Regulatory settings and markets factors will influence the level of competition and services that emerge. NBN might fit Perez’s Kondratieff-like ‘long waves’ model but its roll-out has been delayed by local factors such as bargaining games, telecommunications market failure and institutional issues. The NBN Co’s government monopsony also limits capital markets involvement and, consequently, a true valuation market. Small and medium enterprises who develop new NBN markets or information services may in time be forced to start mergers and acquisitions that, ultimately, favour larger incumbents. These factors could limit the NBN and Australia’s internet futures. Furthermore, NBN’s growth is in a democratic society which means it will be different to the Confucian and Juche logics of Singapore and South Korean NBN-like solutions. Whilst the Sociology of Expectations suggests policymakers, academics and others and will continue to envision NBN-like (digital economy) capabilities, there is the risk of coordination failure, roll-out problems, and, possibly, colonised futures (Brown et al., 2000).
Discussion
Whilst the above analysis is only a high-level assessment it suggests discussion in Australia of potential internet futures is dominated by a limited number of ‘schools’ and ‘image’ categories. Our reading of the current NBN debates and consideration of potential internet futures is there is little consideration of the Chaos Rules, nor the potential for ‘bubbles’ (and for associated unrealistic expectations), unfolding ‘disruption’, unintended consequences, or co-existence/co-option. The NDES fails to address the potential for sectoral disruptions, and associated indirect negative effects. Holistic consideration of potential futures and associated outcomes could better inform planning and decision-making. Methodological and conceptual improvements could be made by using other futures tools and exploring interconnections. Examination of potential secondorder and third-order consequences could be improved by using ‘Futures Wheels’. Interconnections appear to exist, for example, between ‘bubbles’ and ‘unintended consequences’. If the Government and NBN Co – through the return to 1990s utopian internet rhetoric – contribute to speculative bubbles emerging, then this may have social consequences that unintentionally later impair the envisioned digital future and current ‘real’ economy. Furthermore, a major “social bubble” may be necessary to mobilise the needed commitments and major investments by innovators and entrepreneurs to realise the ‘promises’ and cause ‘disruptions’ (Gisler et al., 2011).
Conclusion
In this paper we have outlined and considered key ‘schools of thought’ (or mental models) on internet futures and additional analytical and theoretical perspectives that provide insights into potential internet futures – both internationally and in Australia. Through a brief case study, we have shown how a resulting technological futures framework could be used to quickly highlight potential futures through a deductive ‘incasting’ process. We make several contributions to the literature on internet futures and technology foresight. First, we built on the Smart Internet 2010 project (Barr, Burns, & Sharp, 2005) and its four ‘schools of thought’. We have updated examples 45 to include contemporary debates. The current dominant ‘frames’ are understandable as expressions of the default ‘mental model’ on internet futures, Rich Media, along with Adaptive User Environments, which also informed development of the NBN. Second, through literature review we identified five image categories which can be used as predetermined images of the future for incasting. The first three images – promised futures, social/speculative bubbles, and disruption/chaos – deal primarily with change dynamics. The last two images – unintended consequences, co-existence/ co-option – primarily bring out potential outcomes such as regarding competition and interest politics, risk, and social impacts. Analyst consideration of the categories enables asking “devil’s advocate” questions (Wright & Cairns, 2011; Taleb, 2007) which challenges dominant ‘frames’ and stimulates consideration of multiple viewpoints which is needed for effective scenario thinking. Like Smart Internet 2010’s schools of thought, these predetermined images are relatively open-ended and can be revised with future examples, along with analysis of other domains. Each school of thought and image category provides important perspectives for analysing the emergence of the NBN and potential Australian internet futures. Widely accepted expectations inform the application scenarios, use cases and supply-side research supporting the NBN and similar technology debates. The NBN is in some ways a return to the past, reminiscent of the ‘information superhighway’ rhetoric in the 1990s. What the incasting exercise reveals, however, is that a more plausible mixture of outcomes should be considered by planners and strategists in Australian internet future scenarios along with a broader move beyond dualistic discussion of internet futures (either utopian emancipatory or dystopian). Broader perspectives could consider critical analysis of Web 2.0 and global internet futures (Lessig, 2001; Lanier, 2010; Morozov, 2011) and integrate this with critical futures studies perspectives.
Notes
1 These conflicting political positions present important political risks. This is particularly true if the Opposition Liberal Party wins the next Federal election scheduled for 2013. It is likely to be more difficult for a Liberal Federal Government Australia's Potential Internet Futures Journal of Futures Studies 46 to discontinue/dismantle the NBN if it is elected in 2017 (the subsequent Federal). If fully rolled-out the NBN will “connect 93% of homes, schools and workplaces with optical fibre (fibre to the premises or ‘FTTP’)” and “for the remaining 7% we will connect to our next generation fixed wireless and satellite”. 2 Australia is a small market which raises the potential for various market failures and associated uncertainties about the how many players can be supported in some sectors (Stafford, 2011). 3 As per the market forecasts and analysis of Telsyte (http://www.telsyte.com.au).

USER REQUEST:
From this text, how do the five generic images for the technological future differ to the four schools of thought articulated in the Smart Internet Technology CRC’s report, ""Smart Internet""? Include a brief description of each theory in your explanation.","The five generic images for technological futures differ from the four schools of thought by offering a broader framework for categorizing types of future dynamics, whereas the schools of thought represent specific conceptualizations or ""shared mindsets"" about internet futures. The document states that the five generic images are ""based on a review of different perspectives (such as those described above), technological change theory, and innovation theory"" and serve as ""predetermined images"" for ""incasting"" alternative futures (Considering Alternative Technological and Internet Potentials; Introduction). The four schools of thought, articulated in the Smart Internet Technology CRC’s report Smart Internet 2010, are described as ""shared mindsets"" that ""suggest possible future outcomes"" and each ""encompassed an image of the future, theoretical perspectives, and thought leaders"" (Barr, Burns, & Sharp, 2005, p.7; Current Schools of Thought and Technological Frames).

Here are the descriptions for each:

**Five Generic Images for Technological Futures:**
1.  **Promised future:** This category identifies dominant expectations and visions, informed by the Sociology of Expectations (SoE). SoE scholars suggest that expectations of technologies and their impacts influence technological development, often acting as 'self-fulfilling prophecies.' The more supported an expectation, the more likely key actors are to work towards its realization (Borup et al., 2006; Brown et al., 2000).
2.  **Social/Speculative bubble(s):** This refers to a ""heightened state of speculative fervour"" in markets, often fueled by over-promising and collective over-enthusiasm, which ultimately leads to investment failures and drastic market corrections (Shiller, 2005; Finn & Raskino, 2008; Gisler et al., 2011).
3.  **Disruption/Chaos:** This image is largely defined by Schumpeterian ‘creative destruction,’ which involves the emergence, experimentation, and innovation central to technological change and free markets. 'Chaos' in this context can also present opportunities (Schumpeterian ‘creative destruction’; Geels & Smit, 2000).
4.  **Unintended consequences:** These are social consequences that emerge from second-order and third-order effects of technologies, as well as from the appropriation of technologies by diverse end-user groups for uses unforeseen by their creators (Burns & Eltham, 2009; Jamison & Hard, 2003).
5.  **Co-existence/Co-option:** This focuses on the complex ‘co-evolution’ of technology and society, suggesting that unpredicted futures are more likely than commonly recognized. It also highlights the complex co-existence of old and new technologies, and recognizes that business entrepreneurs and experts often promote futures in which they have a vested interest (Williams, 2006; Geels & Smit, 2000; Brown et al., 2000).

**Four Schools of Thought (articulated in the Smart Internet Technology CRC’s report, ""Smart Internet 2010""):**
1.  **Rich Media:** This was considered the default future, envisioning ""multi-person, multi-device"" access. It anticipated developments such as Australia’s NBN, rural tele-medicine infrastructure, consumer booms in high-definition television, and the Australian Government’s Digital Education Revolution (Barr, Burns, & Sharp, 2005).
2.  **Adaptive User Environments:** This school emphasized end-user experience, adaptability, and design, illustrating how social and cultural factors influence user interaction with Internet-based technologies and services (Barr, Burns, & Sharp, 2005).
3.  **Not the Smart Internet:** This school focused on ""basic services for all"" and ""open standards"" (Barr, Burns, & Sharp, 2005).
4.  **Chaos Rules:** This was a pessimistic and slightly dystopian perspective, questioning the robustness of Internet services due to threats like hackers, viruses, and cyber-warfare, and highlighting the dangers of over-reliance on information technology (Barr, Burns, & Sharp, 2005).","The document outlines two distinct frameworks for analyzing internet futures: the ""four schools of thought"" from the Smart Internet Technology CRC's report ""Smart Internet 2010,"" and five ""generic images of the future."" While both aim to shed light on potential internet trajectories, they differ in their nature, purpose, and the type of analysis they facilitate.

Here's how they differ, along with a description of each theory:

### Four Schools of Thought (from ""Smart Internet 2010"")

These ""schools"" are described as **shared mindsets** or **mental models** that suggest possible future outcomes for the internet. They represent prevailing perspectives or worldviews on how the internet might evolve, often tied to specific trends, actors, or ideologies. They provide different lenses through which to view the internet's future.

1.  **Rich Media:** This was considered the ""default future,"" envisioning a world of ""multi-person, multi-device"" access. It anticipated consumer booms in high-definition television, rural tele-medicine infrastructure, and debates around large-scale projects like Australia's NBN, emphasizing a pervasive computing approach with rich content and high capacity.
2.  **Adaptive User Environments:** This school focused on the end-user experience, adaptability, and design. It highlighted how social and cultural factors influence how users interact with internet-based technologies and services, citing examples like Apple's iPod, iPhone, and iPad, where intuitive design and user-centricity are key.
3.  **Not the Smart Internet:** This perspective emphasized fundamental access and open standards. It advocated for ""basic services for all"" and prioritized widespread, functional, lower-cost, and transparent internet services, often addressing issues of digital divide and equitable access over advanced features.
4.  **Chaos Rules:** This was a more pessimistic and slightly dystopian view. It questioned the robustness of internet services due to threats like hackers, viruses, and cyber-warfare. It also anticipated concerns about over-reliance on information technology and its potential negative impacts on brain function, attention spans, and society, foreshadowing ""Black Swan"" events (low-probability, high-impact occurrences).

### Five Generic Images of the Future

These are presented as **predetermined images** or **categories** that serve as a deductive analytical tool for ""incasting."" Their purpose is to quickly conceptualize alternative futures for a specific technology topic (like the NBN) by exploring different types of outcomes and dynamics of change, irrespective of a particular prevailing mindset. The first three deal with change dynamics, while the last two focus on potential outcomes, risks, and social impacts.

1.  **Promised Future (Dominant expectation[s] and vision[s]):** This image focuses on the widely articulated expectations and visions for a technology, often promoted by actors seeking to build support. It's informed by the Sociology of Expectations, where collective belief and action can act as a ""self-fulfilling prophecy"" to bring a desired future into being. However, it also highlights the risk that such dominant visions can exclude other plausible futures.
2.  **Social/Speculative Bubble(s):** This category describes periods of intense speculative fervor in markets for new technologies, often fueled by hype and over-promising, which typically lead to investment failures and drastic market corrections (hype cycles). Some theories suggest these bubbles are a natural, even necessary, part of major technological revolutions, mobilizing collective enthusiasm and commitment despite high risk.
3.  **Disruption/Chaos:** This image is defined by Schumpeterian ""creative destruction""—the constant emergence, experimentation, and innovation inherent in technological change and free markets. ""Chaos"" here also implies opportunity. Disruption can be technological (e.g., limits to Moore's Law, new manufacturing methods) or driven by social and political factors (e.g., changing social practices, resource scarcity).
4.  **Unintended Consequences:** This image explores the unforeseen social effects that emerge from technologies, including second-order and third-order impacts, and how users appropriate technologies for uses unforeseen by their creators (""the street finds its own use for things""). Examples include distortions in information flow, compromised privacy, unexpected shifts in political power, intensified consumerism, and the rise of cyber-warfare.
5.  **Co-existence/Co-option:** This category emphasizes the complex ""co-evolution"" of technology and society, suggesting that unpredicted futures are more likely than often recognized. It highlights the possibility of old and new technologies co-existing rather than one completely displacing the other. It also acknowledges that futures are often ""contested"" and ""colonized"" by actors with vested interests who promote specific trajectories, and that regulatory and market factors can co-opt or reshape technological development.

### Key Differences Summarized

*   **Nature:** The **schools of thought** are descriptive of different *worldviews* or *perspectives* that exist about the internet's future. The **generic images** are an *analytical framework* or *tool* designed to generate and explore a diverse range of *alternative future scenarios* for a specific technology.
*   **Purpose:** The schools of thought help understand the *prevailing mindsets* influencing technology development and policy. The generic images are a method for *deductively conceptualizing* various *types of future outcomes* or *change dynamics* to broaden the scope of strategic thinking and challenge dominant assumptions.
*   **Focus:** Schools of thought focus on broad *visions* or *interpretations* of how the internet might evolve (e.g., content-rich, user-focused, basic access, or failure). Generic images focus on the *mechanisms* or *patterns* of how technological futures unfold (e.g., promises fulfilled/unfulfilled, speculative cycles, destructive/creative forces, unforeseen impacts, or complex societal integration).

In essence, the ""schools of thought"" describe *how people might think about* the internet's future, while the ""generic images"" offer a structured way to explore *what might actually happen* in the future, encompassing a broader, more critical range of possibilities."

Module 1: The Importance of Merchandising

Merchandising, or how products are displayed in the store, plays a critical role in the overall success of your business.
After all, when customers come into your store, you want them to buy. Effective merchandising is a tool that gets them
closer to that purchase decision.
But having effective merchandising demands discipline and planning. It’s hard work. You must pay attention to detail on a
daily basis. You also must realize that many of your competitors have effective merchandising. That means your customers
are used to seeing it, so they expect it from you, too.
In this course, we’ll discuss the techniques and best practices that make up an effective merchandising strategy. We’ll begin
by talking about why merchandising is so important.
Merchandising makes several important contributions to your store. It increases sales by making a store appealing to your
customers. It improves profitability by generating more margin dollars. It controls costs by improving the productivity of the
salesfloor as well as each employee.
Appeals to Customers
•	 Good merchandising makes shopping easier for customers and gives them reasons to come back
often and spend more money. Remember that many consumers may not consider shopping fun.
A merchandiser’s goal is to take the hassle out of shopping and make it easier.
•	 Good merchandising can also create customer loyalty. Consumers shop where they feel certain they
can find the merchandise they want. They will be loyal to your store if you can create a pleasing
shopping experience and provide what they need.
•	 Finally, good merchandising can promote repeat shopping. One of the best opportunities for growth
comes from building on the business of existing shoppers. When customers know your store is
easy to shop, they will return again and again.
Improves Profitability
•	 One way good merchandising can improve your store’s profitability is by enhancing your price
image. Many consumers may think that independent home improvement retailers have high prices.
The challenge for those retailers, then, is not to have the lowest prices, but to convince consumers
that they are priced competitively for the value and service they offer. Pallet displays in the power
aisle are a good example of how to promote a value-priced image.
•	 Merchandising also allows retailers to make strategic pricing decisions. Through promotional
merchandising techniques, such as dump bins, it’s possible to increase item sales while at the
same time lowering prices.
•	 Merchandising can increase your sales per customer if it’s arranged to promote add-on sales, for example,
through impulse displays at the checkout counter.
•	 Merchandising also promotes self-service shopping. While you can only wait on one customer at a
time, good displays help customers shop on their own. This means you have more time to spend
with customers who need extra help.

Module 1: The Importance of Merchandising (continued)
Increases Salesfloor Productivity
•	 Merchandising can help control costs by helping retailers improve the productivity of the salesfloor.
Productivity improves when retailers can increase sales using their existing salesfloor square
footage and number of employees. Merchandising affects virtually all of the measurements of retail
productivity, such as gross margin and sales per square foot.
•	 Merchandising also makes the salesfloor more productive by suggesting add-on sales and impulse
purchases. It helps organize the store, suggest project ideas, remind customers of items they may
have forgotten and promote special buys.
•	 Merchandising also complements advertising by helping customers find sale items.
Increases Employee Productivity
•	 Good merchandising can help increase your productivity by helping you provide better customer
service. As an employee, you want to spend your time giving customers the product knowledge
they need to solve their home improvement problems. You want to minimize the time you spend
simply directing customers to the aisles where they can find what they need. That’s why you have
signage and merchandising.
•	 Good merchandising makes selling more rewarding. The more customers are able to shop for
themselves, the more time you have to develop new retailing skills. This will help you advance and
gain new responsibilities in the company
Module 2: The Elements of Merchandising
There’s more to merchandising than just having attractive displays. It incorporates the design of the salesfloor, the placement of the
signage and the presentation of the products. When you learn how to merchandise, you learn how to effectively use space, color
and lighting to encourage customers to buy. A well-merchandised store is also a well-organized store. Customers like organized
stores because they can find merchandise quickly and easily on their own. All of the elements of merchandising contribute to
making a store more organized. In this module, we’ll discuss eight elements of merchandising: salesfloor layout, interior signage, cross
merchandising, the use of space, color, lighting, mass displays and interactive technology.
Racetrack Layout
The racetrack layout, also called a loop layout, has the main traffic aisle circling the salesfloor. It gives every major
department exposure on the main aisle. It moves customers through the store and lets them see merchandise in
more departments. It also provides more locations for endcaps, which helps create a value-priced image.
Diagonal Layout
The diagonal layout is a modification of the racetrack layout and can be effective in smaller stores. It
creates several triangular areas in the store and pulls customers to corners they might otherwise miss.
Grid Layout
The grid layout is the simple, traditional layout for a home improvement store. It has straight cross aisles
leading off one or more main aisles into departments. This layout is neat and makes good use of space. Its
main drawback is that is does not put the maximum amount of product in front of customers.
Power Aisle
The power aisle design works well for smaller salesfloors where a racetrack is not practical. It is a
double-width aisle that runs the full length of the store.
This design often includes departmental cross aisles that feed off of the power aisle. The power aisle
gives exposure to most major departments through the use of feature endcaps or promotional mass
displays in the center of the aisle. It makes maximum use of the display area.
Module 2: The Elements of Merchandising
Salesfloor Layout
Most stores are organized into departments, and customers are accustomed to shopping this way. Here are five ways the salesfloor
can be laid out in a typical store.
Project Centers
Project centers and demonstration areas can be developed with any salesfloor layout. They can be used
for classes, workshops or product demonstrations. They are also useful areas for collection points for
how-to information, such as books and product information.
These areas should present products related to projects and focus attention on promoted merchandise.
Signage should suggest projects, explain product features and benefits, talk about prices and highlight
the value of home improvement projects.
Cube Displays
Cube displays are another way smaller stores can get the maximum amount of merchandise on the
salesfloor. These displays use higher fixtures with careful attention to the kinds of merchandise displayed
on higher shelves. An effective way to use cube displays is to put the higher fixtures in the back of the
store to make more merchandise visible from the front and lead customers through the store.

Interior Signing
•	 Signage is an important part of merchandising because it makes shopping easier for customers and
gives them the information to make informed buying decisions.
•	 Signs keep customers in the store longer, move them from department to department and suggest
more items to purchase. In addition to department and aisle signs, shelf and product signs can
convey shopping information.
•	 Some signs provide information about specific products. Signs may also be used to describe
the product’s features, benefits and uses. They should always be neat, easy to read, informative
and compelling.
•	 Signs are also used to provide information about price. They can create urgency if they are used to
identify items as bargains or closeouts. They can also identify advertised items and help establish a
value price image for the store.
•	 Department signs are used to help identify the location of departments in the store, such as paint
or tools. These signs should be visible from the front of the store so customers can quickly find
what they need.
Store Design and Product Presentation
In addition to the layout of the salesfloor, here are some elements of merchandising you may encounter in the store.
Cross Merchandising
•	 Cross merchandising is a term used to describe the placement of products together that are used
together in projects. It is an effective way to show related items that are normally stocked in
different departments. For example, you might show garden gloves next to the shovels. You can
merchandise these items next to each other on the same shelf or across the aisle. Cross-aisle
merchandising is the practice of displaying related merchandise on facing shelves.
•	 Cross merchandising is an effective technique because it makes shopping easier and more
convenient when customers can see several items they need in one location.
•	 This appeals to a customer’s desire to save time because they don’t have to go to multiple areas of
the store to get what they need.
•	 It’s also an effective tool suggesting add-on sales, since related items are together.
•	 Cross merchandising organizes products in the way they are used. In this way, it gives customers
project information. It can also suggest better-quality items.
•	 Here are some ways you can effectively use cross merchandising:
•	 Combine products from different departments.
•	 Promote seasonal projects.
•	 Promote common household repair and maintenance projects.
•	 Display the pairs in the department where customers are most likely to go first.
•	 Look for vendor planograms that utilize cross-merchandising.
•	 Incorporate signage to compare benefits of good-better-best quality.

Use of Space
•	 Merchandising should organize products in the most productive use of the space. Shelves should
be far enough apart that the merchandise fits comfortably, but not waste space. In the same way,
hooks and bins should fit the size of the item. Long- and short-handled items should go together.
•	 The use of space in merchandising also involves placement in the store. Reserve the prime display areas
in the store for items customers are most likely to want. Keep the best display area for high-demand,
fast-moving products. Putting slow movers in prime display spaces won’t make them sell faster. It may
only suggest to customers that they may have to go somewhere else to find what they need.

Executive Summary 
‘Artificial Intelligence’ (‘AI’), comprising machine-learning and other analytical algorithm-based  automated systems, has become an important aspect of our lives. In recent years, this technology has  been increasingly deployed in criminal justice systems across the world, playing an increasingly  significant role in the administration of justice in criminal cases. This trend is often driven by  perceptions about the reliability and impartiality of technological solutions, and pressures to make  cost savings in policing and court services. 
However, studies in various jurisdictions, including in Europe, provide substantial evidence that AI and  machine-learning systems can have a significantly negative influence on criminal justice.  
AI systems have been shown to directly generate and reinforce discriminatory and unjust outcomes;  infringing fundamental rights, they have been found to have little to no positive influence on the  quality of human decisions, and they have been criticised for poor design that does not comply with  human rights standards.  
Most AI systems used in criminal justice systems are statistical models, based on data which is representative of structural biases and inequalities in the societies which the data represents, and  which is always comprehensively lacking in the kind of detail that is needed to make truly ‘accurate’  predictions or decisions. The data used to build and populate these systems is mostly or entirely from  within criminal justice systems, such as law enforcement or crime records. This data does not  represent an accurate record of criminality, but merely a record of law enforcement - the crimes,  locations and groups that are policed within that society, rather than the actual occurrence of crime.  The data reflects social inequalities and discriminatory policing patterns, and its use in these AI  systems merely results in a reinforcement and re-entrenchment of those inequalities and  discrimination in criminal justice outcomes.  
Given these extremely serious risks, strong regulatory frameworks are needed to govern the use of AI  in criminal justice decision-making and, in some circumstances, to restrict its use entirely.  
Existing EU data protection laws restrict the use of automated decisions, but there are gaps and  ambiguities that could result in the use of AI systems in ways that undermine human rights, if not  accompanied by further guidance or legislation.  
Firstly, EU laws currently only prohibit decisions that are solely based on automated processes, but  they do not regulate decision-making processes that are largely dependent on automated systems.  Given that most AI systems in use today are designed and deployed to assist, rather than replace, human decision-making in criminal justice systems, they largely fall outside the remit of EU data  protection laws on automated decisions. Secondly, the prohibition on automated decisions is subject  to broad exceptions. Individuals can be subject to decisions based solely on automated processes if  authorised by EU or Member State law, and there are deemed to be appropriate human rights  safeguards in place, including the right to obtain human intervention. However, there is not enough  clarity on what safeguards are needed, and how ‘human intervention’ should be interpreted.  
In order to regulate the use of AI in criminal justice proceedings, the EU must, at a minimum, set  standards to address the following questions: 
1) what standards are needed to govern the design and deployment of AI systems in criminal  justice systems;  
2) what safeguards are needed in criminal justice proceedings to make sure that AI systems are  used in accordance with human rights standards and prevent discrimination; and 
 
3) how Member States should govern the deployment of AI systems and monitor their  subsequent use.  
The design of AI systems and their deployment in criminal justice proceedings should be regulated to generate human rights compliant, non-discriminatory outcomes. Minimum standards and safeguards  should be set, which, if they cannot be adhered to, should preclude the use of the AI system in  question. AI should also be regulated so that they are sufficiently transparent and explainable to  enable effective independent scrutiny. AI systems should be designed and deployed to comply with  and give effect to inter alia the right of access to court, the right to be presumed innocent, and the  right to liberty. AI systems should not undermine the right to be tried by an impartial and independent  tribunal and, in line with existing EU laws, no individual should be subject to an automated decision  that results in a criminal record. AI systems should be designed so that they do not pre-designate an  individual as a criminal before trial, nor should they allow the police to take unjustified,  disproportionate measures against individuals without reasonable suspicion. AI systems that inform  criminal justice outcomes should, as a general rule, favour outcomes that are favourable to the  defendant. Where AI systems inform decisions on the deprivations of liberty, they should be calibrated  to generate outcomes that favour release, and they should not facilitate detention other than as a  measure of last resort. AI systems must be subject to rigorous testing to ensure that they have the  desired effect of reducing pre-trial detention rates. 
AI systems must be developed to guarantee that they do not generate discriminatory outcomes,  ensuring that suspects and accused persons are not disadvantaged, either directly or indirectly, on  account of their protected characteristics, including race, ethnicity, nationality or socioeconomic  background. AI systems should be subject to mandatory testing before and after deployment so that  any discriminatory impact can be identified and addressed. AI systems which cannot adhere to this  minimum standard should have no place in the criminal justice system. 
AI systems need to be transparent and explainable, so they can be understood and scrutinised by their  primary users, suspects and accused persons, and the general public. Commercial or proprietary  interests should never be a barrier to transparency. AI systems must be designed in a way that allows  criminal defendants to understand and contest the decisions made against them. It should be possible  to carry out an independent audit of each AI system, and its processes should be reproducible for that  purpose. 
Member States should have laws that govern how AI systems are relied upon in criminal proceedings,  and there must be adequate safeguards to prevent over-reliance on AI by decision-makers, to prevent  discrimination and to ensure scrutiny and effective challenge by the defence.  
Procedural safeguards should actively tackle automation-bias amongst criminal justice decision makers. Examples include:  
a) making it a legal requirement for decision-makers to be adequately alerted and informed  about the risks associated with AI systems; 
b) making AI systems’ assessments intelligible to decision-makers; 
c) requiring decision-makers to provide full, individualised reasoning for all decisions influenced  by an AI system; and 
d) making it easy for decision-makers to overrule AI assessments that produce unfavourable  outcomes for defendants.  
Criminal justice procedures should ensure that defendants are notified if an AI system has been used  which has or may have influenced a decision taken about them at any point in the criminal justice 

system, from investigation to arrest, from charge to conviction, and sentence. Procedures should  enable the full disclosure of all aspects of AI systems that are necessary for suspects and accused  persons to contest their findings. Disclosure should be in a form which is clear and comprehensible to  a layperson, without the need for technical or expert assistance, in order to ensure fairness, equality  of arms, and to discharge the obligations to provide all relevant information and be given reasons for  decisions under the right to a fair trial. Suspects and accused persons should also be given effective  access to technical experts who can help to analyse and challenge otherwise incomprehensible  aspects of AI systems. Training should be made available to all primary users of AI systems, and to  criminal defence practitioners, so that there is greater awareness of AI technology, and of the risks of  over-reliance on AI.  
Effective regulation of AI systems should be facilitated by a governance and monitoring framework.  AI systems should not be deployed unless they have undergone an independent public impact  assessment with the involvement of appropriate experts, that is specific both to the purpose for which  the AI system is deployed, and the locality where it is deployed. A requirement of the assessment  should be a consideration of whether it is necessary to use AI in the particular use case, or whether  an alternative solution could achieve the same aims.  
As far as it is possible to do so, AI systems should also be tested for impact pre-deployment, a part of  which should be the minimum requirement to prove that the AI system has no discriminatory impact,  either directly or indirectly, before it can be deployed. AI systems should be kept under regular review  post-deployment. Effective monitoring of AI systems is not possible unless there is sufficient data that  makes it possible to discern their real impact. In particular, Member States need to collect data that  allow them to identify discriminatory impacts of AI systems, including discrimination on the basis of  race and ethnicity. 

Background 
Rapid technological advancements in recent years have made artificial intelligence (‘AI’) an  increasingly prominent aspect of our lives.  
There are differences of opinion as to the definition of AI and its true meaning, but for the purposes  of this paper we are broadly referring to automated decision-making systems based on algorithms,  including machine-learning, which are used in the criminal justice system. 
There is little doubt that AI has great capacity to increase human potential and improve the lives of  many, but the increasing role of AI in assisting important public functions has also highlighted serious  risks and challenges. If not subject to proper regulation and oversight, AI can threaten fundamental  human rights and, far from expanding human potential, it can amplify and worsen harmful aspects of  our society, including inequality and injustice.  
This challenge is particularly evident where AI has been used to assist the administration of justice in  criminal cases. In recent years, more and more jurisdictions across the world have begun to use AI  technology to inform and assist policing and judicial decisions, often driven by perceptions about the  reliability and impartiality of technological solutions, and pressures to make cost-savings in policing  and court services. In some countries, algorithmic processes can influence which geographic  neighbourhoods should be subject to increased law enforcement and when, as well as which  individuals should be specifically targeted by law enforcement. They can help to determine whether  someone should be arrested, whether they should be charged with a criminal offence, whether they  should be detained in prison before trial and, if convicted and sentenced, the length of their sentence.  AI is being used more and more to influence highly sensitive, high impact decisions that have far reaching, long-term implications for individuals’ rights.  
Research emerging from the United States, where the use of AI in criminal justice is particularly  widespread, and from the United Kingdom and some EU Member States, however, seriously questions  whether AI has a positive influence on criminal justice systems. AI tools and systems have been found  to actively generate discriminatory criminal justice outcomes, they have been found to have little to  no positive influence on the quality of human decisions, and they have been criticised for poor design,  that does not reflect or give effect to human rights standards. These criticisms might not be justified  for all AI systems, but these studies highlight the need for much stronger regulatory frameworks to  govern the use of AI.  
We believe that unless it is subject to robust regulation, it is unlikely that AI can be used in criminal  justice systems without undermining the right to a fair trial. In some cases, it should be restricted from  use entirely. 
EU Member States should be encouraged to take a much more cautious approach to AI and subject  automated processes to more stringent rules that are designed to ensure human rights compliance. 
There is the potential for AI systems, if properly and robustly regulated, to have a positive impact on  criminal justice system, advancing human rights, for example, by analysing law enforcement or judicial  decisions to identify patterns of erroneous or poor decision-making, or discrimination.  
The EU is already a world leader on AI regulation, having adopted ground-breaking data protection  laws in recent years to shield individuals from automated decisions that have an adverse effect on  their rights. We welcome the EU’s commitment to build further on existing legal standards, and we  emphasise that addressing the impact of AI on criminal justice has to be a primary consideration for  EU policy makers when deciding on appropriate legal standards. Discussions around the impact of AI

on human rights have largely been centred on data protection, the right to privacy, and broader  questions of ethics and human dignity. However, despite the increasing use of AI systems in criminal  justice systems across the world, only limited discussions have so far focused on how these systems  impact the right to a fair trial, and what regulations are needed to address that impact.  
About this paper 
Fair Trials has produced this policy paper to highlight the need for EU-wide standards on the regulation  of AI in criminal justice, and to inform EU policy makers about the standards and safeguards needed  to ensure effective protection of fair trial rights where criminal justice decisions are assisted by AI.  
The EU Commission recognised that AI represents risks for fundamental rights, including the right to  a fair trial, in its 2020 White Paper, ‘On Artificial Intelligence – A European approach to excellence and  trust’. It also recognised the need for improvements to the EU’s legislative framework on AI, noting in  particular the challenges in the ‘effective application and enforcement of existing EU and national  legislation’ and the ‘limitations of scope of existing EU legislation’.  
In this paper, we identify the most common fair trial rights issues raised by existing AI systems, based  on examples and experiences from the EU, the United Kingdom, and the United States. We also offer  examples of practical legal and policy solutions that could help to address these challenges, and to  assist in the effective implementation of the EU’s fundamental rights standards in this area. We  recognise that the use of AI has a broader impact on human rights beyond the right to a fair trial, and  that there are important social and ethical issues that also need to be addressed. However, we have  narrowed the focus of this paper given Fair Trials’ mission and field of expertise. 
This paper should not be treated as an exhaustive list of fair trial rights standards that need to be  introduced. AI is used in many ways in criminal justice systems cross the world and, as the technology  continues to develop, it is likely that we will eventually see the deployment of AI technology in ways  never imagined before. This paper focuses primarily on AI systems that carry out individualised risk  assessments, given that these types of systems have had the most significant impact on individuals’  rights so far, and we envisage that similar systems will become increasingly common in the near  future. 

Existing EU Legal Framework 
Existing EU laws restrict the use of automated decisions in a wide variety of contexts. Article 22 of the  General Data Protection Regulation (‘GDPR’) provides that data subjects have the right not to be  subject to decisions ‘solely’ based on automated processes, where they produce ‘legal effects’  concerning them, or where they ‘similarly significantly affect’ them. The Law Enforcement Directive  (‘LED’) – the EU data legislation that governs the processing of data for criminal justice purposes – has  a very similar provision at Article 11, which requires Member States to prohibit decisions based solely  on automated processing, where they produce ‘adverse legal effects’ on the individual, or effects that  are ‘similarly significant’.  
However, there are two notable gaps in the existing legislative framework governing automated  decision-making systems under both the GDPR and the LED. These ambiguities and potential  loopholes could be exploited in ways that seriously undermine the general prohibition of automated  decision-making processes, and adversely impact human rights. It is necessary, therefore, that the EU  provides further guidance on how these provisions should be interpreted, including thorough  legislation (if appropriate) to further clarify the circumstances in which Member States are allowed to  deploy AI systems for criminal justice proceedings.  
Firstly, the provisions in the GDPR and LED only prohibit decisions based ‘solely’ on automated  processes. In other words, the laws regulate the impact of decisions made through automated  processing, but not the AI systems themselves. As discussed later in this paper, the main human rights  challenges of AI systems can be attributed to how they are designed and trained, and the types of  technology used, such as machine-learning, so it is crucial that decisions about the design and  deployment of AI systems are also regulated.  
Secondly, neither the GDPR or LED provide regulatory standards to govern situations where  automated processing is not the ‘sole’ basis of a decision, but a primary influencer. In reality, the  difference between a fully automated decision and a decision made with a ‘human-in-the-loop’ is not  always clear, but because of this strict classification, AI systems are able to be used and have significant  legal effects without the corresponding safeguards. Stronger legal standards are needed to make sure  that semi-automated decision-making processes do not become de facto automated processes. 
Thirdly, the prohibition on automated decision-making is subject to two very broad exceptions.  Automated decisions are prohibited under the GDPR and LED, ‘unless authorised by Union or Member  State law’ and there need to be ‘appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of the data  subject, at least the right to obtain human intervention’.1 These provisions give extremely wide  discretion to Member States to override the general prohibition. It is significant that EU laws  emphasise the need for human rights safeguards, and the need to ensure the possibility of human  interventions, but neither of these concepts have yet been adequately defined. Although influential  actors like the EU and the Council of Europe have established principles on the ethical and responsible  use of AI, there is currently no authoritative guidance on the practical safeguards that need to be in  place.2Likewise, the meaning of ‘human intervention’ is open to interpretation. LED provides some  guidance on who should be carrying out the human intervention,3 but there needs to be greater clarity  on what meaningful human intervention entails in different contexts. 
In order to regulate the use of AI in criminal justice proceedings, and close the gaps in existing data  protection laws, the EU must, at a minimum, set standards to address the following questions: 
1) what standards are needed to govern the design and deployment of AI systems in criminal  justice systems;  
2) what safeguards are needed in criminal justice proceedings to make sure that AI systems are  used in accordance with human rights standards and prevent discrimination; and  3) how Member States should govern the deployment of AI systems and monitor their  subsequent use.

Part 1: Regulating the Design and Deployment of AI Systems in Criminal Justice Systems 
AI systems deployed to assist criminal justice decision-making have to be fit-for-purpose. The purposes  of AI systems differ depending on the context in which they are deployed, but there are a few common  considerations that need to be taken into account to determine whether it is appropriate for the AI  system to be used.  
Firstly, AI systems have to be designed to produce outcomes that are desirable from a human rights  and non-discrimination perspective. This means that rather than being exclusively focused on  delivering ‘accurate’ outcomes in criminal cases, AI systems have to be designed to facilitate fair,  impartial and non-discriminatory criminal processes. Developers of AI systems and public entities that  commission them should, in particular, make sure that AI systems are consciously designed to give  effect to, and promote the right to fair trial. The fundamental issues with the way AI systems are  designed and built, resulting in discriminatory outcomes, must also be considered. Given the  significant evidence of AI systems influencing discriminatory outcomes, special efforts must be made  to ensure that AI systems do not produce discriminatory outcomes.  
Secondly, AI systems need to be designed in a way that makes it possible for criminal defendants and  the broader public to scrutinise them. This means that AI systems should not only be made open to  scrutiny (rather than concealed to protect commercial interests), but their inner workings and  processes should also be discernible and comprehensible.  
AI Systems should be designed to protect and promote the right to a fair trial 
Where AI systems are used to assist or inform criminal justice decisions, they support an important  act of public administration that has a significant impact on the rights of suspects and accused persons.  AI systems do more than just provide outputs that decision-makers can take into consideration as  evidence. By attempting to mimic human analytical processes and reasoning, they can provide  influential advisory input into human decision-making, or even replace it altogether. As such, it is right  that human rights standards that govern criminal justice decision-making also apply to AI systems. 
The Council of Europe and the EU Commission’s High Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence (‘AI  HLEG’) have both recognised that fundamental rights should be a key guiding principle for the design  and deployment of AI systems.4 The Council of Europe recommends that AI systems are built according  to ‘human rights by design’ principles, and recognises that AI systems should not undermine the right  to a fair trial under the European Convention on Human Rights (‘ECHR’). The AI HLEG has similarly  recognised that the respect for fundamental rights, as enshrined in the EU Charter of Fundamental  Rights and international human rights instruments, should form the foundations of trustworthy AI. AI  HLEG’s Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI (‘the Ethics Guidelines’) also recognise the need for AI  systems to comply with other types of EU legislation. Although not mentioned explicitly in the Ethics  Guidelines, Fair Trials would emphasise that the design of AI systems and the ways in which they are  deployed in the EU should, in particular, be compatible with the standards set out in the procedural rights directives under the ‘Roadmap for strengthening procedural rights of suspected or accused  persons in criminal proceedings’.5 
We would also like to note the potential for AI systems to have a positive impact on criminal justice  systems. Public debate about the relationship between AI and human rights have predominantly been  centred on the idea that AI is a threat to human rights. It is equally important, as technology takes an  increasingly prominent role in public life, to consider what positive potential they may have. Policy 
makers, developers, civil society activists, and other stakeholders should try to identify ways in which  AI can also play an active role in advancing human rights, and improve the fairness of criminal justice  systems. For example, AI systems could be used to analyse law enforcement or judicial decisions to  identify patterns of erroneous or poor decision-making, or discrimination, for preventative purposes.  
AI systems which are used as part of criminal justice decision-making should be designed not just to  ensure that they do not undermine the right to a fair trial, but also to promote it. However, as  explained below, given the embedded biases in the criminal data used to develop and train AI systems,  there are serious doubts, based on recent studies, whether AI systems can promote fair criminal  justice at all.  
There are various aspects of the right to a fair trial and, without speculating on what kind of AI systems  will be developed in the future to support criminal justice decision-making, it is difficult to articulate  how fair trial rights standards should inform the design of AI systems. However, examples of AI  systems currently deployed in the EU and elsewhere suggest that there are certain aspects of the right  to a fair trial that require special attention. These are: 
a) the right of access to court 
b) the presumption of innocence; 
c) the principle of the equality of arms; and  
d) the right to liberty.  
Access to Court 
The notion of AI systems replacing courts to determine the guilt or innocence of the accused may  seem far-fetched at present, but there is a growing trend of automated administration of justice across  the world that might threaten the right of access to court. For example, in several European countries,  speeding and other minor traffic offences have been detected and enforced by means of automated  processes for more than a decade.6 Although nominally criminal processes, these types of proceedings  are, in reality, normally administrative in nature, and they rarely have a ‘significant’ impact on the  rights of individuals. However, as surveillance technology develops, thanks to AI, there is a real  likelihood that the scope of crimes punishable by way of automation will increase.7 
In the United Kingdom, the government announced plans in 2017 that would enable defendants to  enter guilty pleas via an online portal after viewing the charges and evidence against them, for a small number of minor offences.8 Under this procedure, known as ‘automatic online conviction’, defendants  would be automatically convicted and fined without any judicial oversight if they accept the charges  against them. Although it is debatable whether this system can truly be characterised as an AI system,  it is an example of the automated administration of criminal justice, that replaces a function usually  played by courts.  
It is worrying that the UK government has proposed expanding this scheme to other ‘non imprisonable’ offences, if itis regarded as a success.9Fair Trials has outlined concerns about expanding  the scope of cases where accused persons can be convicted without judicial oversight, even if such  procedures are reserved solely for minor, non-imprisonable offences.10 The impacts of a criminal  conviction, even for a minor offence, can be numerous, long-term, and hard to predict, affecting inter  alia job prospects, educational opportunities, and immigration status. It is crucial that what amounts  to ‘legal effects’ and ‘similar significant effects’ concerning the data subject for the purposes of  automated decision-making are interpreted very broadly.11 In particular, given that a criminal record  always has a ‘legal’ or ‘significant’ effect, any automated decision-making process that directly results  in a criminal record should be prohibited.  
AI systems should not undermine the right to be tried by an impartial and independent tribunal,  and in line with existing EU laws, no individual should be subject to an automated decision that  resultsin their being held in custody or detention, gives them a criminal record, or which determines  a criminal sentence or sanction. No individual should be subject to an automated decision which  engages their human rights without meaningful human input. 
Presumption of Innocence 
The right to be presumed innocent in criminal proceedings is a basic human right, and one that is  expressly recognised in, and safeguarded by EU law under Directive 2016/343 (the ‘Presumption of  Innocence Directive’).12 The increasing use of AI in the sphere of criminal justice, however, raises  questions about the scope of this right, and how AI systems should be built and used to protect it.  Concerns about how AI systems undermine the presumption of innocence have been voiced in the  context of certain types of predictive policing software.13 
A variety of predictive policing tools that aim to facilitate preventative policing measures and to deter  crimes before they have taken place have been developed and deployed across Europe.14 Tools which  predict the time and place where certain crimes are likely to take place have been used in many European countries. Similar tools have also been developed to identify potential suspects, which are  used widely in the US, and now increasingly in Europe.15 
An example is the ‘Strategic Subject List’ in Chicago, a police database of around 400,000 local  residents who were assigned threat scores that determine the likelihood that they will commit  crimes.16 The algorithms used to generate these scores were not open to the public, so the exact  process by which individual risk levels were assessed were not known. Despite this lack of  transparency, it is clear that threat scores generated by the software had significant impacts on  individuals’ rights – in particular, their right to privacy. Individuals with higher threat scores were, for  example, more likely to be subject to targeted police surveillance, or home visits – as though they  were officially recognised as predisposed to commit crimes, irrespective of any credible suspicion of  wrongdoing.17 The Strategic Subject List was decommissioned in January 2020 by the Chicago police  who cited ineffectiveness as the primary reason for the decision.18 
These types of predictive policing tools are now being used in Europe. In the United Kingdom, a  coalition of police forces have been developing a system not dissimilar to the Strategic Subject List,  that aims to identify individuals who are likely to commit crimes.19 Known as the National Data  Analytics Solution (‘NDAS’), this risk assessment tool uses statistical analysis and machine-learning to  inform policing decisions, and to facilitate ‘early interventions’ where appropriate.20 The sources of  data that the system uses to conduct its risk assessments raise concerns that the system will be built  to profile individuals on the basis of very sensitive, personal information, including stop and search  data, data from social services, and the National Health Service.21 Where this data is used to indicate  the likelihood of individuals’ criminality, it will inevitably flag up people whose profiles fit those who are over-represented in that data as being higher risk. It is particularly worrying that an individual  might be profiled for policing purposes on the basis of their health conditions or their access to  essential services, such as welfare or benefits. These factors should not be regarded as relevant factors  for determining whether someone may commit criminal offences. 
Also in the UK, the Metropolitan Police in London operates a database called the Gangs Matrix, which  contains information and risk-assessments on individuals who are alleged ‘gang’ members.22 This  database was created using criminal justice data, including police and crime records. The Gangs Matrix  and the assessments it produces assists policing decisions, including the deployment of stop and  search, and further enforcement action, such as imprisonment and deportation. A further tactic  resulting from the risk assessments made by the Gangs Matrix is the threat of eviction or exclusion from education, as names and details of these alleged gang members have been shared with education, healthcare and housing providers.23 
In the Netherlands, the government has been running an algorithmic risk assessment tool, ProKid 12- SI, which purports to assess the risk of criminality of 12-year-old children since 2009.24 ProKid uses  existing police data on these children, such as reports of where children have come into contact with  the police, their addresses, information about their ‘living environment’, even including whether they  are victims of violence, to identify them as being in one of four categories of ‘risk’ of committing crimes in future.25 The system assesses children based on their relationships with other people and their  supposed risk levels, meaning that individuals can be deemed higher risk by being linked to another  individual with a high risk assessment, such as a sibling or a friend.26 Parents’ assessed risk can also  impact a child’s risk level. ProKid’s algorithms assess risks in relation to future actions that the children  have not yet carried out, and judges them on the basis of the actions of others close to them.27 These  risk assessments result in police ‘registering’ these children on their systems and monitoring them,  and then referring them to youth ‘care’ services.28 ProKid frames children as potential perpetrators  even when they are registered as victims of violence; which has serious implications on their presumption of innocence.29 
Several similar tools are also used in the Netherlands, including the Reference Index for High Risk  Youth, a large-scale risk assessment system that focuses on assessing under-23-year-olds.30 
Predictive policing tools like NDAS, ProKid and the Gangs Matrix can be regarded as part of a broader  trend in law enforcement that moves away from ‘reactive’ policing, and towards ‘preventative’ or  ‘proactive’ policing.31 NDAS and other similar predictive policing tools intend to pursue legitimate  objectives of preventing, or reducing harm,32 but there are serious concerns that these systems single out individuals as ‘pre-criminals’, who are subject to police interventions even though they are not  formally suspected of any crime, and there is no evidence that they have done anything wrong.33 It is  of further concern that these types of predictive policing tools do not necessarily designate individuals’  risk levels on the basis of their past actions, or behaviour that can be regarded as ‘suspicious’ in any way, but on account of factors far beyond their control, and immutable characteristics. In particular,  there is strong evidence to suggest that AI systems have a tendency to overestimate the risks of  criminality of certain ethnic and racial groups. For example, out of 3,800 people on the Gangs Matrix,  80% are 12-24 years old, and 78% of them are black – a clearly disproportionate and discriminatory proportion. The discriminatory impact of AI in criminal justice systems is discussed in further detail in  the following section. 
Although predictive policing tools do not directly ‘convict’ people, they not only allow the police to  treat legally innocent individuals as pseudo-criminals, but they can also result individuals being  deprived of their basic rights with regard to education, housing, and other public services – effectively  ‘punishing’ them on account of their profiles. This seriously damages the fundamental human rights  principle that the matter of guilt or innocence can only be determined by means of a fair and lawful  criminal justice process.34 
While it is clear that certain types of predictive policing can infringe the presumption of innocence  from a moral and ethical viewpoint, it is debatable whether these systems also violate the legal  presumption of innocence under EU law and international human rights law. The Presumption of  Innocence Directive applies to natural persons who are ‘suspects’ and ‘accused persons’, from the  moment they are suspected or accused of a crime.35 However, there is some ambiguity about the  exact stage at which an individual attains the status of a ‘suspect’ under the Presumption of Innocence  Directive,36 and about whether the scope of the Presumption of Innocence Directive extends to  decisions to designate an individual as a suspect (or a ‘pre-criminal’). On the other hand, the ECHR appears to have taken a clearer position that measures undertaken pre-charge, as a general rule, fall  outside the scope of the presumption of innocence.37 It has also held that preventative measures, such  as surveillance, do not amount to criminal sanctions for the purposes of Article 6 ECHR.38 
Even if the current language on the presumption of innocence is such that it is not directly applicable  to the predictive policing context, it must be recognised that these tools nevertheless interfere with  human rights. In particular, the targeted surveillance that results from predictive policing has clear  implications on the right to privacy. The acceptable degree to which criminal justice processes can  interfere with this right is a matter that might require clearer articulation, as is the question of the  impact of Article 8 ECHR violations on criminal proceedings.  
AI systems that inform charging decisions have also been developed and deployed. An example of this  is the Harm Assessment Risk Tool (‘HART’) currently being used by Durham Constabulary in the United  Kingdom. HART uses a machine-learning algorithm to assess a suspect’s risk of reoffending, using over  thirty variables that characterise an individual’s criminal history and socio-demographic background.  The risk assessments conducted by HART are used by the local police to determine whether an  individual should be charged, or diverted into a rehabilitation programme. HART does not determine  whether an individual is guilty or innocent, but its assessment can trigger a chain of events that can  result in the deprivation of liberty, and/or a criminal conviction. Charging decisions should surely be  based on the merits of individual cases, and it is difficult to imagine how decisions on entry into  diversion programmes can be made by means other than a careful consideration of individual circumstances. These types of high impact, fact-sensitive decisions should never be delegated to  automated processes, particularly those which operate by identifying correlations rather than causal  links between an individual’s characteristics and their likely behaviour.  
An examination of HART also reveals flaws in how the tool is designed. HART is calibrated to err on  the side of caution,39 because it regards under-estimations of risk levels as a more serious error than  over-estimations, so that under-estimations occur less frequently. In other words, HART is deliberately  designed to underestimate who is eligible for entry into the diversion programme, so it is predisposed  to over-criminalise. This approach conflicts with the notion that any doubt in a criminal case should  be interpreted in favour of the defendant (‘in dubio reo’).40 A human rights compliant approach to  criminal justice decision-making would do the opposite of what HART does – it would need to err on  the side of the defendant.  
AI systems should respect the presumption of innocence and they must be designed so that they do  not pre-designate an individual as a criminal before trial, nor should they allow or assist the police  to take unjustified, disproportionate measures against individuals without reasonable suspicion. AI  systems that inform criminal justice outcomes should, as a general rule, favour outcomes that are  favourable to the defendant. 
Equality of Arms 
A major concern raised in the studies of certain AI systems is that they are inaccessible for adequate  scrutiny by defendants and their lawyers. This has serious implications for the principle of equality of  arms and the right to an adversarial process, because without information about how a decision is  made, it is difficult to envisage how defendants can question the accuracy and legality of the decision.  The need for AI systems used in criminal justice to be transparent, explainable and understandable to  all is addressed in more detail below. 
The Right to Liberty 
In the United States, ‘risk-assessment’ tools that use AI technology have been used to assist pre-trial  assessments that determine whether a defendant should be released on bail, or held on remand pending their trial. Examples of risk-assessment tools currently being used in the United States include  COMPAS, the Public Safety Assessment (‘PSA’), and the Federal Pre-Trial Risk Assessment Instrument  (‘PTRA’). Many of these tools are also used to inform decisions on parole and sentencing.  
These tools have, however, been subject to intense criticism for several reasons. Studies have shown  inter alia that risk assessments make inaccurate predictions that are no better than those made by  non-expert humans. They do not result in a significant reduction in pre-trial detention rates, and that  they produce disparate outcomes for different racial groups. The US-based NGO Partnership on AI has  found that AI risk assessment tools currently being used in the United States are unfit for use in pre trial assessments, and it has recommended that policymakers cease the deployment of risk  assessment tools until such time that the challenges affecting such tools have been adequately  addressed.41 
The adoption of pre-trial risk-assessments tools in the United States has largely been driven by the  desire to address high imprisonment rates in the country by making pre-trial decision-making fairer.  
In particular, these tools have been promoted as an alternative to cash bail – a system often criticised  for disadvantaging poorer defendants and worsening social injustices.42 Cash bail is a relatively rare  concept in the EU, but there are concerns about the quality of pre-trial detention decisions in many  Member States, which have been criticised for failing to carry out case-specific reviews and fully  consider alternatives to detention.43  
We are currently unaware of any attempts in EU Member States to introduce algorithmic risk  assessments to supplement or replace existing pre-trial decision-making processes. However, it is  possible that risk-assessment tools will also be recommended as a solution to address the pre-trial  detention challenge in Europe, especially given that many of these tools are developed by private  companies that actively market their products to governments and local police forces.  
Risk-assessment tools are usually designed to assess the likelihood of re-arrest, and/or of failure to  turn up to court after being released based on the profiles of the defendant. Based on these  assessments, risk assessment tools either assign risk levels to defendants, or they provide direct advice  to decision-makers on whether or not the defendant should be released. There is only limited research  about the extent to which pre-trial risk-assessment tools influence judges’ decisions in practice,44 but  concerns have been raised about the ability of AI systems to recommend detention at all.45 There is a  risk that recommendations made by AI systems to detain individuals compromise the presumption of  release. This is a particularly valid concern in light of research suggesting that decision-makers have a  tendency to err on the side of caution when they are ‘advised’ by AI systems, and that they have a  greater propensity to override risk assessment tools to detain, rather than release defendants.46 Pre trial detention should always be a measure of last resort, and no risk-assessment can be regarded as  human rights compliant, unless it recommends its users to consider detention as a measure of last  resort, after all other alternatives have been fully considered. 
Pre-trial risk assessment tools in the United States and elsewhere have also been criticised for  (unintentionally) over-estimating risks, because of the nature of the data used to train its algorithms.  
Pre-trialrisk assessment tools typically rely only on data regarding individuals who have been released,  and they ignore those who were detained, but would have otherwise ‘succeeded’ by not being  arrested, and by appearing in court.47 In other words, algorithms are based on the assumption that  individuals who have been detained by courts in the past have been rightfully deprived of their liberty.  Any AI system developed to assist pre-trial detention decision-making must be designed to give effect  to the presumption in favour of release. This means that risk-assessment tools need to be deliberately  calibrated to generate outcomes that favourable to the defendant. Data used to train the AI system  should be carefully scrutinised so that it reflects the inevitable fact that a significant proportion of  individuals in pre-trial detention have been deprived of their liberty in violation of their human rights.
Studies of pre-trial risk-assessment tools used in the United States cast doubt on their effectiveness  at reducing pre-trial detention rates, and their ability to make accurate predictions of risks. A study in  Kentucky, for example, found that the likelihood of defendants being released within the first three  days of their arrest went down after the risk-assessment tool was deployed, and that there were no  significant changes in the number of re-arrests and failure-to-appear rates amongst defendants  released on bail during the same period.48 This was the case even after the risk-assessment tool was  modified post-deployment to improve the accuracy of predictions. Another study has found that the  COMPAS risk-assessment tool is no better at predicting the likelihood of defendants reoffending than  non-expert human volunteers.49 These studies do not necessarily prove that AI systems are incapable  of reducing pre-trial detention rates at all, but they do raise questions about their usefulness, and they  strongly challenge claims that algorithmic risk-assessment tools help to improve the quality of pre trial detention decisions. They also highlight the need for post-deployment testing and monitoring of  AI systems, to ensure that they have the desired effect of ensuring that individuals are detained only  as a measure of last resort. 
Post-trial assessment systems are also being increasingly used, for purposes such as assisting with sentencing decisions or prisoner release. 
In England and Wales, the Prison and Probation Service has developed and operates the Offender  Assessment System (OASys), an automated risk-assessment tool.50 It assesses the risk of harm  offenders pose to others and how likely an offender is to reoffend, as well as assessing offender needs.  These risk assessments are used to decide ‘interventions’ and to influence the sentence plans given  to offenders.51 Millions of these assessments have been carried out.52 The system collates information  on offenders’ previous offences, education, training, employment, alcohol and drug misuse; as well as  their ‘attitudes’, ‘thinking and behaviour’, ‘relationships’, and ‘lifestyle’.53 This data is used alongside  the individual’s offending record and ‘offender demographic information’ to inform two predictive  algorithms: OASys General Reoffending Predictor (OGP1) and OASys Violence Predictor (OVP1).54 A  2014 National Offender Management Service analysis found that the OGP1 and OVP1 generated  different predictions based on race and gender. They found that relative predictive validity was better  for white offenders than for Asian, black, or mixed ethnicity offenders. The Offender Group  Reconviction Scale (OGRS) is another algorithmic risk assessment tool, which is used in England and  Wales to assess and predict an offender’s likelihood of reoffending.55 The OGRS algorithm uses data on the individual’s official criminal history, as well as their age and gender, to produce a risk score  between 0 and 1 of how likely an offender is to reoffend within one or two years. 
The use of these AI systems in a post-trial setting, and the documented differences in predictive  outcomes based on, among other factors, race, highlight the clear need for strict testing and  monitoring of such systems. These systems used in a post-trial setting could very easily be transferred  to a pre-trial risk assessment setting; the principles and aims of these systems and the data used are  very similar. For example, the COMPAS system, mentioned above and considered in more detail  below, was originally designed as a recidivism risk assessment tool, and is also used as a pre-trial risk  assessment tool. 56 
Where AI systems inform decisions on the deprivations of liberty, they should be calibrated to  generate outcomes that favour release, and they should not facilitate detention other than as a  measure of last resort. AI systems must be subject to rigorous testing to ensure they have the  desired effect of reducing rates of pre-trial detention rates. 
AI systems should be designed to be non-discriminatory 
One of the most frequent criticisms of AI systems and their use in criminal justice systems is that they  can lead to discriminatory outcomes, especially along racial and ethnic lines.  
The best-known example of this is a study by the US media outlet ProPublica into COMPAS, a risk assessment tool designed to predict the likelihood of reoffending in Broward County in Florida.  ProPublica found that COMPAS was 77% more likely to rate black defendants as ‘high-risk’ than white  defendants, and it was almost twice as likely to mislabel white defendants as lower risk than black  defendants.57 
The dangers of the failure to adequately regulate the use of AI to prevent discrimination have also  been witnessed in Europe. The ‘Crime Anticipation System’ (‘CAS’), a predictive policing software  being used across the Netherlands, was initially designed to consider ethnicity as a relevant factor for  determining the likelihood of a crime being committed. Amongst the indicators used by CAS to predict  crimes in a particular area was the number of ‘non-Western allochtones’ in the area – in other words,  ‘non-Western’ individuals with at least one foreign-born parent.58 The software not only presupposed  the existence of a correlation between ethnicity and crime, but also singled out a category of  ethnicities to be of particular concern, given that the presence of ‘Western’, ‘autochtone’ individuals  were not used as indicators. Furthermore, given that ‘Western’ was defined somewhat subjectively  (for example, including individuals of Japanese or Indonesian origin, and including all European  nationalities, apart from Turkish), CAS incorporated highly questionable societal categorisations and  biases. 
In the United Kingdom, a major criticism of HART has been that it included data collated and classified  by a private company for marketing purposes that could very easily to biased outcomes. HART relied  on the ‘Mosaic’ code developed by a consumer credit reporting company, that categorised individuals  into various groups according to inter alia their ethnic origin, income, and education levels. It was of particular concern that some socio-demographic categories used by Mosaic were blatantly racialised,  including, for example, ‘Asian Heritage’, which stereotyped individuals of ‘Asian’ origin as being  unemployed or having low-paid jobs, and living with extended families.59 
In Denmark, an automated algorithmic assessment has been used to classify different  neighbourhoods, based on criteria such as unemployment, crime rates, educational attainment, and  other ‘risk indicators’, as well as whether the levels of first and second-generation migrants in the  population is more than 50%. Neighbourhoods which meet these criteria are classified as ‘ghettos’.  These neighbourhoods are then subject to special measures, including higher punishments for  crimes.60 It is clearly discriminatory, as well as entirely unfair, for people living in certain areas to be  punished more severely than others in different areas for the same crimes. 
Further examples of criminal justice AI which have been identified as producing discriminatory  outcomes include the previously mentioned OASys, NDAS and the Gangs Matrix in the UK, and the  Netherland’s ProKid 12.  
These examples illustrate the need for regulations to ensure that AI systems are designed to be non discriminatory, and to exclude categorisations and classifications that deepen and legitimise social  biases and stereotypes. However, policy makers should not assume that making AI systems blind to  all protected characteristics will always help to produce non-discriminatory outcomes. In certain  scenarios, the removal of protected characteristics from the data could worsen discrimination. For  example, it has been suggested on the basis of research into COMPAS in the United States, that  excluding gender as a variable for risk assessments would fail to reflect a well-established statistical  fact that in most countries, women are less likely to reoffend than men.61 Making COMPAS gender 
blind would unfairly and inaccurately assume women to be as equally likely to reoffend as men, and  discriminate against them by overestimating their risk scores.  
Removing visible biases from AI systems cannot be the sole or primary solution to their discriminatory  impact, because AI systems can be biased even if they have not been deliberately designed in that  way. Bias is often unintentional, and even if the AI system appears on the surface to be neutral, their  algorithms can lead to discriminatory assessments and outcomes. COMPAS, for example, does not  include race or ethnicity as a variable, yet research has found that it consistently gives black  defendants higher risk scores than their white counterparts, making them less likely to be released  from detention.62 
Hidden biases can arise in AI systems in numerous ways. Although a comprehensive analysis of how  they can cause unintentional biases are beyond the scope of this paper,63 the way in which AI systems are themselves created and built illustrate the difficulty, complexity, and sometimes impossibility, in  preventing discriminatory outputs and effects of AI systems.  
There are fundamental issues with the way AI systems are designed and created which can lead to  bias. Where the AI system is based on machine-learning, biases can result from faults in the data that  is used to train its algorithms. Machine learning systems ‘learn’ how to make assessments or decisions  on the basis of their analysis of data to which they have previously been exposed. However, the data  used to train a machine learning system might be incomplete, inaccurate, or selected for improper  reasons, and this could lead to AI systems producing unwanted outcomes. What amounts to  appropriate, good quality data for the purpose of training algorithms depends on what the machine  learning system is being designed to do,64 so it might not always be obvious which dataset is needed  to train algorithms to be non-discriminatory. 
AI designed or created for use in the criminal justice system will almost inevitably use data which is  heavily reliant on, or entirely from within, the criminal justice system itself, such as policing or crime  records. This data does not represent an accurate record of criminality, but is merely a record of  policing – the crimes, locations and groups that are policed within that society, rather than the actual  occurrence of crime. The data might not be categorised or deliberately manipulated to yield  discriminatory results, but it may reflect the structural biases and inequalities in the society which the  data represents.  
Where there are discriminatory policing patterns targeting certain demographics, or the systematic  under-reporting and systematic over-reporting of certain types of crime and in certain locations,65 the  use of such data merely results in a reinforcing and re-entrenching of those inequalities and  discriminationin criminal justice outcomes. For example, according to UK crime data, black people are  over 9 times more likely to be stopped and searched than white people,66 and black men are more  than 3 times more likely to be arrested than white men.67 Despite these statistics, NDAS (mentioned  above) in the United Kingdom explicitly relies on stop and search data to determine an individual’s  propensity to commit a criminal offence. The fact that stop and search is disproportionately used  against black people means that there will inevitably be an overrepresentation of black people in NDAS  and that their risk levels will be inflated in comparison to white people.  
Comparable statistics on stop and search are not available in most EU Member States, where the  official collection of racially disaggregated criminal justice data is either forbidden by law, or not  standard practice. However, recent studies show that racially biased policing practices are prevalent  throughout the EU. Data collected from a survey by the Fundamental Rights Agency, for example, has shown that during a 5-year period, 66% of individuals of Sub-Saharan African origin in Austria, and  over half of respondents of South Asian origin in Greece were stopped and searched.68 
AI built on data embedded with such biases and used to assist, inform, or make decisions in the  criminal justice system, can expand and entrench the biases represented in the data.69 When AI  systems result in criminal justice outcomes which repeat the discrimination inherent in the historic  data, such as targeting individuals from a particular demographic, that decision will itself be preserved  in the data. This leads to self-perpetuating ‘feedback loops’ which reinforce patterns of inequality.70 
Another way in which AI systems can produce unintentional biases is by way of proxies. Data used by  AI systems might be classified in seemingly legitimate ways, but those classifications can sometimes  act as proxies for protected characteristics. A common example used to illustrate this point is how  home addresses or postcodes can be proxies for race or ethnicity.71 Certain AI systems, such as HART,  were initially trained to find correlations between home addresses and the risk of reoffending – in  other words, to identify which postcode areas have ‘higher-risk’ residents than others.72 This approach  overlooks the fact that there is very pronounced ethnic residential segregation in many countries,73 making it highly probable in practice, for AI systems to inadvertently establish a link between ethnic  origin and risk. 
Roma are especially vulnerable to this form of proxy discrimination, given that in many EU Member  States, Roma are reported to live primarily in segregated areas inhabited mostly or exclusively by  Roma.74 
There are several ways in which AI systems can be designed to mitigate the risks of discrimination,  including by identifying and excluding data classifications that act as proxies for protected  characteristics.75 However, it can be difficult in practice to identify which variables are proxies for  protected characteristics (and how they do so), and removing too many ‘offending’ variables might  result in the AI system losing much of its functional utility.76 There is no one-size-fits-all method of  ensuring that AI systems do not produce discriminatory outcomes. Different approaches to de-biasing  AI systems can conflict with one another, and the suitability of a particular de-biasing method might  depend on the AI tool itself, and the legal and policy context in which it is designed to operate.77 Biases in AI systems are often not easy to detect and, in many cases, it might also be difficult to pinpoint  flaws either in the system itself, or in the training data that has been caused the bias. The structural  bias within the data that AI systems are built and operated on, a bias which is particularly deep-rooted  in criminal justice data, is a fundamental issue, and one which is likely to result in AI systems being  fundamentally inoperable – both because the bias makes them morally and ethically inoperable, if not  yet legally, and because any attempts to remove the bias will make the data to operate these systems  unusable.  
Fair Trials’ view is that the only effective way in which AI systems can be regarded as non discriminatory is if they have been subject to rigorous independent testing for biases. These tests must  be mandated by law, must be independently run, have clearly stated aims or objectives, and be carried  out pre-deployment to reduce the likelihood of individuals being affected by discriminatory profiling  and decisions. AI can be tested in advance of deployment by using test data – datasets which are either  synthetic datasets,78 or by using historic data with permissions – running it through an AI system, and  analysing the outputs.79 For example, a trial of retrospective facial recognition video analysis is being  run by a police oversight Ethics Committee in the UK. The trial is using historic data – CCTV footage – 
as the basis for simulated investigations in a controlled environment, monitored by researchers. The  trial has clearly stated aims and signifiers of success, and all outcomes will be examined. There are  significant human rights, data protection and ethical concerns involved with this particular technology,  including the right to privacy, and the testing is not being conducted independently as it should be but, as above, there are positive aspects of the testing methodology.80 
An alternative could be to ‘test’ a system in a strictly academic sense by running it alongside actual  criminal justice processes, but with the system not having any effect on decision-making, and  analysing the system’s proposed decisions or outcomes for bias.  
AI should never be used or even ‘tested’ in real-world situations where they have actual effects on  individuals or criminal justice outcomes, before they have been tested. These types of tests also need  to be carried out in the broader context of an AI governance framework that not only analyses the  potential impact of the AI system pre-deployment, but also continues to monitor its impact  afterwards. 
If these tests are not carried out, and/or if an AI system cannot be proven to be non-discriminatory, it  should be legally precluded from deployment. However, as explained in the final section of this paper,  it is questionable whether such tests are feasible in many Member States, where local laws prohibit  the collection of racially-disaggregated data.  
AI systems should be developed to generate non-discriminatory outcomes, ensuring that suspects  and accused persons are not disadvantaged, either directly or indirectly, on account of their  protected characteristics, including race or ethnicity. AI systems should be subject to mandatory  testing before and after deployment so that any discriminatory impact can be identified and addressed. If an AI system cannot be proven not to generate discriminatory outcomes, it should not  be used. 
AI Systems need to be transparent and explainable 
AI systems can have a significant influence over criminal justice decisions, and they should be open to  public scrutiny in the same way that all decision-making processes by public entities should be.  However, a common criticism of many AI systems is that they lack transparency, which often makes it  difficult, if not outright impossible, to subject them to meaningful impartial analysis and criticism. This  lack of transparency is both as a result of deliberate efforts to conceal the inner workings of AI systems  for legal or profit-driven reasons, and of the nature of the technology used to build AI systems that is  uninterpretable for most, if not all humans.  
There are several reasons why it is necessary for AI systems to be transparent. Firstly, transparency is  essential for strengthening confidence of both primary users of the system, as well as the general  public, in AI systems. Democratic values demand that the public needs to be aware of how powerful  public institutions, such as the police and the judiciary, operate so that they can be held accountable  for their actions. It is also crucial for primary users of AI systems to understand how they work, so that  they can make informed decisions about how much influence they should have on criminal justice  decisions.  
Secondly, decisions made by AI systems need to be contestable at an individual level. Standards on  the right to a fair trial and the right to liberty demand that defendants should have access to materials  that inform decisions regarding them, so that they can challenge the accuracy and lawfulness of those  decisions.  
Transparency also acts as a safeguard against bias and inaccuracies. It is difficult to imagine how issues  that undermine the fairness and accuracies of AI systems (such as racial biases) can be detected, and  ultimately fixed, if they cannot be properly accessed and analysed. As explained above, certain AI  systems, such as CAS, have been found to have serious, but very obvious, flaws. In CAS’s case,  however, the fault in the software could be detected easily, which meant that the discriminatory impact of the tool could be mitigated. The indicator for ‘non-Western allochtones’ in CAS was removed  in 2017,81 ostensibly because it served no useful purpose, but presumably also because of the very  obvious bias. This mitigation was possible because CAS is a transparent software, that was developed  in-house by the Dutch police. The types of indicators used to predict crime were made openly  available, and information about the method by which the software made predictions could easily be  accessed and understood.82 
This, however, is not the case for all AI systems, because AI systems are often developed by for-profit companies with little to no meaningful input from the public. As such, details of how they are  designed, and how they make decisions and assessments are, in many cases, closely guarded as trade  secrets that are protected by law.83 Often, AI systems are ‘black boxes’ because they are deliberately  kept that way. While it is accepted that strong, enforceable intellectual property laws are needed to  promote advancements in what is a very dynamic field of scientific research and innovation, it is not acceptable that these concerns trump the rights of individuals suspected or accused of crimes. In light  of this, it is concerning that the Commission’s White Paper focuses on, and strongly promotes, the  concept of a ‘partnership between the private and the public sector’ in relation to AI.84 Fair Trials  appreciates that effective public-private collaboration could help to fill in gaps in public sector  expertise and capacity for the development of AI systems, but given the transparency challenges, it is  essential thatsuch partnerships are accompanied by robust regulations and rules that ensure effective  and open scrutiny.  
However, even if AI systems are completely exposed to public scrutiny, and their source code85 and  input data, for example, are openly disclosed, there is still no guarantee that they will be sufficiently  transparent to enable adequate independent scrutiny. AI systems can be black boxes by nature of the  technology that makes their decision-making processes complicated beyond comprehension for most  (in some cases, too complicated even for computer scientists to understand).86 This is especially the  case where AI systems are based on machine-learning algorithms.  
One possible reason for the unintelligibility of AI systems is that they sometimes use machine-learning  algorithms that are simply too complex to be understood to a reasonable degree of precision.87 This  is especially the case where AI systems incorporate ‘Deep Neural Networks’ – a machine-learning  algorithmic architecture inspired by the structure and mechanics of human brains. Rather than relying  on a set of man-made instructions, these types of AI systems make decisions based on experience and  learning. Decision-making processes of this kind have been described to be ‘intuitive’, because they  do not follow a defined logical method, making it impossible to analyse the exact process by which a  particular decision is reached.88 It has also been suggested that some AI systems are uninterpretable  to humans because the machine-learning algorithms that support them are able to identify and rely  on geometric relationships that humans cannot visualise. Certain machine-learning algorithms are  able to make decisions by analysing many variables at once, and by finding correlations and geometric  patterns between them in ways that are beyond the capabilities of human brains.89  
Given these challenges, there is widespread recognition that states should require AI systems to not  only be ‘transparent’, but also explainable and intelligible.90 GDPR already recognises that individuals  should have the right to an explanation of how a decision was reached, if they have been subject to  an automated decision.91 In principle, this is an essential and very useful requirement, but it is also  one that seems difficult to implement in practice, given that both ‘explainability’ and intelligibility are  highly subjective concepts. Arguably, AI systems’ computing processes are inherently difficult to  explain and understand for most people, including for most criminal justice decision-makers, but this  surely should not be the sole basis for oversimplifying the technology, or for banning the use of AI  outright.  
Computer scientists have been theorising different ways of ensuring that decisions made through  complex algorithms can be explained and understood. An example is the ‘explainable AI’ movement  (‘xAI’) that aims to build AI systems that can show more discernible links between inputted data and  decisions. xAI systems measure how each input influences the final decision, so it is possible figure out  how much weight is given to each input.92 This seems to be an innovative response to the ‘black box’  challenge, establishing clearer, more helpful relationships between inputs and final decisions.  However, it appears to fall short of explaining what happens between data being inputted into the  system and the final decision, and it does not enable users to impute any logic to the decision-making  process.93 
As explained above, there are various reasons why AI systems need to be transparent and intelligible,  but the effective of exercise of the rights of the defence must be recognised as a crucial test for  determining whether an AI system is sufficiently explainable and intelligible. AI systems have to be  designed in a way that allows criminal defendants to understand and contest the decision made  against them. Partnership for AI has suggested that a central factor that determines the contestability  of AI systems is the possibility of carrying out an audit trail of the AI decision.94 In particular, it has to  be possible for an auditor to follow and reproduce the process and come to the same conclusion  reached by the AI system at the end.  
Furthermore, as explained in further detail below, criminal justice procedures should require the full  disclosure of all aspects of AI systems that are necessary for suspects and accused persons to contest  their findings, and this disclosure should be in a form which is understandable to a layperson, without  the need for technical or expert assistance. 
AI systems need to be transparent and explainable, so they can be understood and scrutinised by  their primary users, suspects and accused persons, as well as the general public. Commercial or  proprietary interests, or technical concerns, should never be a barrier to transparency. AI systems  must be designed in a way that allows criminal defendants to understand and contest the decision  made against them. It should be possible to carry out an independent audit, and processes should  be reproducible.  


Part 2: Safeguards for the use of AI Systems in Criminal Proceedings 
AI systems have to be built in accordance with human rights principles, and to give effect to human  rights in practice, but it is unlikely that their design alone will guarantee that they are used in ways  that comply with human rights. Regulatory frameworks for the design and deployment of AI systems  have to be accompanied by appropriate legal safeguards that ensure they are used responsibly and  lawfully. There are two primary questions that need to be addressed: 
1) how procedural rules ensure that decision-makers do not over-rely on AI systems; and 2) how decisions and assessments made by AI systems can be analysed independently and  challenged. 
Combatting ‘Automation Bias’ and Reinforcing Meaningful Human Input 
One of the main challenges of automated, or semi-automated decision-making systems is that of  ‘automation bias’ – the tendency to over-rely on automation in ways that can cause errors in decision making. Automation bias occurs primarily due to the perception that automated decision-making  processes are generally trustworthy and reliable. Automated cues have been found to be particularly  salient to decision-makers, and research has shown that users of automated decision-making systems  have a tendency to place greater weight on automated assessments over other sources of advice.95 
The disproportionate influence of automated systems can undermine the quality of decision-making,  by discouraging its users from consulting a wider range of factors that could inform more accurate  decisions.  
Most AI systems currently being used to assist criminal justice decision-making do not completely  replace human decision-making. They are instead designed and deployed to be used as decision aids,  whose outputs are factored into consideration for the purposes of human decision-making. The  phenomenon of automation bias however, raises questions about whether AI systems are being used  in reality in accordance with their intended purpose as decision aids, and not as de facto replacements  for human decision-making processes.  
There is strong evidentiary basis for automation bias amongst pilots who, like judges and other  decision-makers in criminal justice proceedings, have typically been through a high level of training to  make appropriate decisions in highly complex settings.96 However, limited research into automation  bias amongst judges suggests that AI systems might have a more complex impact on judges’  behaviour. For example, a study conducted in 2019 in Kentucky seems to suggest that the degree to  which judges rely on predictive tools for pre-trial detention decision-making could be influenced by  the ethnicity of the defendant.97 The research indicates that judges had a greater tendency to rely on  algorithmic risk assessments where the defendant was white, whereas in cases where the defendant  was black, judges were more likely to overrule the risk-assessment in favour of detaining them. This  study appears to show that AI systems can influence judges’ behaviour in unpredictable ways,  especially where there are interactions or conflicts between automation and human biases, and that  AI systems might be an ineffective tool for challenging human prejudices. It is crucial that rules governing the use of AI systems in criminal proceedings actively try to counter  automation bias, and to encourage decision-makers to make independent determinations. A simple  requirement to have a human decision-maker ‘in the loop’ or to have a human decision-maker review  or check the automated decision is insufficient, because this risks overestimating the capacity or  willingness of human decision-makers to question and overrule automated decisions. A mere requirement to have an automated decision reviewed by a human, on its own, could reduce the  human review into a rubber-stamping exercise which, in practice, is no oversight at all.  
In recognition of this challenge, the European Data Protection Board has recommended that in order  for decisions to be regarded as not ‘based solely’ on automated processing for the purposes of Article  22 GDPR, there has to be ‘meaningful’ human oversight, rather than just a token gesture.98 What  qualifies as ‘meaningful’ intervention is open to interpretation, and it is likely to differ depending on  the circumstances and the type of decision being made. In the context of criminal justice procedures,  where decisions often have particularly severe and far-reaching implications for individuals’ rights,  safeguards for ensuring meaningful human intervention have to be especially robust. 
Procedural safeguards that ensure ‘meaningful’ human oversight 
Rules governing the use of AI systems in criminal justice proceedings have to counter automation  bias by encouraging human decision-makers to treat their processes with scepticism, and to force  them to challenge and scrutinise the outcomes of algorithmic assessments.  
Procedural safeguards that can be put in place to tackle automation bias include: 
a) making it a legal requirement for decision-makers to be adequately alerted and informed  about the risks associated with AI systems; 
b) making AI systems’ assessments intelligible to decision-makers; 
c) requiring decision-makers to provide full, individualised reasoning for all decisions  influenced by an AI system; and 
d) making it easier for decision-makers to overrule AI assessments that produce unfavourable  outcomes for defendants.  
One way of ensuring that automated assessments and decisions do not have undue influence on  judicial decisions might be to ensure that decision-makers are sufficiently informed and alerted about  the risks of relying on AI systems. This seems to be the approach taken by the Wisconsin Supreme  Court in the United States in the case of Loomis,99 in which the Court considered whether or not the  use of the COMPAS risk assessment tool for sentencing purposes violated due process rights. The  judgment in Loomis recognises the importance of procedural safeguards as a way of safeguarding  fairness of decisions, by requiring the use of ‘written advisements’ to alert decision-makers about the  potential risks of AI risk assessments. Specifically, the court mandated that these advisements had to  include warnings that: a) the process by which the COMPAS produces risk scores were not disclosed  due to its ‘proprietary nature’; b) the accuracy of risk scores are undermined by the fact that COMPAS  relied on group data; c) the risk-assessment tool had never been tested locally for accuracy; d)  ‘questions’ have been raised about the discriminatory effect of COMPAS risk-assessments; and e)  COMPAS was developed to inform post-sentencing decisions, but not sentencing decisions  themselves. These warnings are clearly very specific to COMPAS and the context in which it is used in Wisconsin.  If similar safeguards were adopted in different contexts and with regard to different AI systems,  advisements will no doubt need to be adapted. The warnings used in Loomis have, however, been  criticised because they do not give enough information to decision-makers to enable them to  appreciate the degree to which these risk-assessments should be discounted.100 In particular, the  advisements are silent on the strength of the criticisms against COMPAS, and they say nothing about  the basis on which questions about their discriminatory effect have been raised.101 These warnings  also give no indication about likely margin of error of the assessment, so although judges are informed  that some assessments might be inaccurate, they are not in a position to appreciate how serious or  frequent these errors might be. 
‘Advisements’, or warnings that encourage decision-makers to be sceptical of AI systems cannot be  considered as effective safeguards, unless they contain sufficiently helpful information for decision makers. However, even if judges are given stronger warnings than those in the Loomis advisements,  it is still doubtful whether they alone will adequately mitigate automation bias. One reason for this is  that many criminal justice decisions (such as pre-trial detention decisions) are, in practice, made very  routinely by judges. Although written advisements might initially help judges think more critically  about automated risk assessments, over time, these advisements could become repetitive and  routine, and lose much of the intended meaning and effect.102 
An effective safeguard that could work in conjunction with mandatory warnings could be for decision makers to be given a better insight into how AI systems produce a particular assessment or calculation.  As mentioned above, the lack of information about how assessments are made by AI systems makes  it harder for criminal defendants to scrutinise and challenge them. Surely, this has to be true also for  decision-makers. It is much harder, if not impossible, to analyse and criticise decisions if there is no  reasoning behind them. While AI systems do not rely on ‘reasoning’ per se, information given to  decisions about how a specific assessment was made, including what factors were relevant, and how  much weight was given to each factor could give decision-makers more confidence to decide whether  to agree or disagree with an AI-generated decision.  
Decisions or assessments made by AI systems cannot be the sole basis of criminal justice decisions – they should be no more than a factor that can influence human-decision making. As such, decision makers should be required to show that decisions were influenced by a broader range of factors other  than the AI system, by way of fully reasoned, case-specific, written decisions. Research has shown that  the lack of case-specific reasoning in pre-trial detention decisions is already a serious challenge in  many EU Member States,103 and AI systems risk worsening the standardisation of such decision making processes. Where AI systems are used to inform pre-trial detention decisions, or any other  criminal justice decision that has a significant impact on the rights of the defendant, reasoned  decisions must be specific to the defendant’s case, and in particular, they must reveal what which  factors influenced the decision, and to what degree. In particular, decisions have to make it clear how  much weight was given to assessments by AI systems. 
It is also crucial that decision-makers are able to override decisions made by AI systems, and that they  are confident about doing so where the tool produces assessments or recommendations that are  unfavourable to the defendant (e.g. where the AI system advises against releasing the defendant). It  has been reported that members of the police force in Avon and Somerset Police in the United  Kingdom are expected to record incidences where they have disagreed with assessments made by a  predictive policing tool, and to explain their reasons for the disagreement.104 This is likely to act as a  strong disincentive for overriding decisions made by the AI system, and as such, it actively facilitates  automation bias. Furthermore, it seems to interfere with the presumption of innocence by making it  difficult for decision-makers to override AI systems to make decisions that favour the defendant. If an  AI system recommends the arrest or the detention of an individual, decision-makers should feel that  they have a genuine choice of overruling the AI system, and not be pressured into compliance.  Criminal justice decision-making processes should, as a general rule, be skewed in favour of the  defence to give effect to the presumption of innocence, and rules governing the use of AI systems  should favour favourable outcomes for defendants.  
On the other hand, in cases where a decision-maker acts against the advice of an AI system that  recommends a favourable outcome for the defendant, there should be a requirement for reasons to  be given for their decision. This is to prevent unfavourable outcomes for defendants that are  motivated by improper reasons, and to mitigate the risk of unconscious bias. 
Challenging AI in criminal proceedings 
AI systems need to be contestable by criminal defendants. This is so that they can not only challenge  the outcomes of the AI systems’ calculations and analyses, but also scrutinise the legality of their use.  In other words, being able to challenge AI systems in criminal proceedings is not only a procedural  fairness requirement for defendants, it is also a means by which legal standards governing AI systems  and their use can be enforced.  
One of the major issues preventing the sufficient contestability of AI systems in criminal proceedings  is the lack of notification. If an individual is not notified that they have been subject to an automated  decision by an AI system, they will not have the ability to challenge that decision, or the information  that the decision was based on. 
For example, in the United Kingdom, the Data Protection Act 2018 sets out the applicability of the  GDPR and sets out the UK’s interpretations of the GDPR’s requirements and safeguards. However, section 14 of the Data Protection Act significantly dilutes the requirements of Article 22 of the GDPR,  permitting purely automated decisions which have legal or similar significant effects on a data subject,  without their consent, as long as the data subject is subsequently notified that a purely automated  decision has been taken about them, after the decision has been made. It is only then that the data  subject has the opportunity to request a new decision.  
However, it has been reported that individuals subject to decisions by the HART system in the UK are  not notified at all that they have been subject to such an automated decision, even after it has been  made.105 This is likely because under the Data Protection Act 2018, automated decisions which have  legal or similar significant effects on a subject are not necessarily classified as ‘purely automated’ if a  human has administrative input. In order to meet this requirement, the human input can be as minimal as checking a box to accept the automated-decision, even if it has a significant impact on an  individual, such as holding them in custody. This minimal requirement for human requirement means  that, in practice, decisions made with negligible to no meaningful human input can be classified as not  “purely automated” and there is no legal requirement to notify and ability to request a new decision.  In this way, systems such as HART continue to be used, with people subject to their decisions  completely uninformed. 
While the GDPR already requires the notification of individuals affected by automated decisions, the  UK’s experience with HART highlights the need for stricter rules to not only ensure meaningful human  input (as mentioned above), but to also strengthen the individual’s right to be notified.  
There must be a requirement for individuals to be notified, not just for “purely automated” decisions,  but whenever there has been an automated decision-making system involved, assistive or otherwise,  that has or may have impacted a criminal justice decision. This notification should include clear and  comprehensible information about the decision that has been taken, how that decision was reached,  including details of the information or data involved in reaching that decision, what the result or  outcomes of the decision are, and what effects, legal or otherwise they have, and information on how  to challenge that decision. 
As discussed in the previous section, a further major barrier to the contestability of AI systems is a  technical one. The ‘black box’ nature of certain AI systems can be largely attributed to their design, so  it is important that there are rules governing the interpretability of these systems so that when they  are in use, their processes can be understood at all. However, there are also legal barriers to the full  disclosure of AI systems, which are often put in place to protect commercial interests. Procedural  safeguards play a particularly important and effective role in addressing these types of opacity  challenges. 
Transparency is a fundamental aspect of an adversarial process that underpins the right to a fair trial,  and human rights standards require that as a general rule defendants should be given unrestricted  access to their case-file,106 and to be given the opportunity to comment on the evidence used against  them.107 These standards are further reinforced by Directive 2012/13/EU,108 which requires Member  States to grant access to all material evidence in possession of the competent authorities to the  defence to safeguard the fairness of the proceedings and to enable defendants to prepare their  defence.109 The procedural requirement of an adversarial process is not one that is limited to  substantive criminal proceedings – it also applies in the context of pre-trial decision-making processes,  especially for decisions on the deprivation of liberty.110 While EU law and international human rights  law also recognise that there might be certain justifications for non-disclosure of materials used  against the defendant in criminal proceedings, these are narrow restrictions, and commercial interests  are not regarded as a valid justification for non-disclosure.111 Furthermore, EU law does not explicitly  recognise any derogations from the right of access to materials that are essential to challenging the lawfulness of an arrest or detention.112 In order for Member States to comply with these standards,  any exceptions to the disclosure of information regarding AI systems have to be applied very narrowly.  
Barriers to scrutiny and accountability of AI systems are not only legal, but also technical. As explained  in previous sections, many AI systems suffer from interpretability issues because of their design and  by the nature of the machine-learning technology upon which they rely. In the absence of specific  expertise on AI, it is difficult to imagine how, in practice, defendants and their lawyers will be able to  challenge AI systems.  
One possible solution to this challenge, as explained below, is training for defence lawyers – but it is  unreasonable to expect lawyers to develop expertise that would enable them to analyse and scrutinise  AI systems at a technical level. A further solution could be that defence lawyers have access to the  relevant expertise from suitably qualified professionals. 
However, in reality, not all criminal suspects and accused persons are able to access the legal and  other technical assistance needed to understand and challenge technically complex AI systems, for  financial or other practical reasons. It would also be unreasonable and unrealistic to require all  suspects and accused persons to engage technical expertise just to be able to understand how an AI  system makes a decision, especially where AI systems are used routinely or mandatorily to make or assist criminal justice decisions. 
It might seem unreasonable to expect all highly technical evidence to be challengeable by lay  defendants without the help of a suitable expert. However, AI systems are not necessarily used in  criminal proceedings as ‘evidence’, and in practice they could be an integral part of a decision-making  process, or even a replacement for it. As such, it is essential that the ‘reasoning’ of AI systems are  made known to suspects and accused persons, similarly to how judicial decisions must contain  “sufficient reasoning and address specific features of a given case”, especially where they concern the  deprivation of liberty.113 Decision-making processes of AI systems and the way in which it has  produced an outcome in a particular case should thus be disclosed to suspects and accused persons,  in a form that is intelligible to a layperson. Individuals should not need to rely on experts to simply  understand how a decision affecting them was made. While there will inevitably be scenarios where  defendants would need expertise to challenge an AI-assisted decision, but these cases should be the  exception, rather than the norm, for whenever an AI system is used.  
Criminal justice procedures should require the notification to suspects and accused persons where  an AI system has been used which has or may have impacted a decision made about that individual.  Procedures should enable the full disclosure of all aspects of AI systems that are necessary for  suspects and accused persons to contest their findings. Disclosure should be in a form which is  comprehensible to a layperson, without the need for technical or expert assistance, and suspects  and accused persons should also be given effective access to technical experts who can help to  analyse and challenge otherwise incomprehensible aspects of AI systems. 
Training 
AI systems use technology not well understood by many people. Without proper training, outputs of  AI systems might not be easy to interpret, and it might be difficult to appreciate which factors  undermine the reliability of AI systems, so that appropriate weight can be attached to their findings.  As mentioned above, decision-makers can be warned about the weaknesses of AI systems as part of their decision-making process, but the effectiveness of this safeguard can be questioned, because it is  unlikely to provide decision-makers with all the information they need, and there is no guarantee that  the warnings will be taken seriously in all cases.  
Training is not just needed for the primary users of AI systems, such as judges and police officers who  use them to inform their own decisions. The training must also be available criminal defence lawyers,  so that they are in a better position to challenge AI systems, where necessary. If AI systems are used  routinely to aid criminal justice decisions or even made mandatory (as is the case in certain states in  the United States), there would be strong justification for governing bodies to make training on AI  mandatory for criminal justice practitioners.

Part 3: Governance and Monitoring 
Criminal justice processes are an important enforcement mechanism for ensuring that AI systems are  designed and used lawfully, but they cannot be the sole, or even the primary means of implementing  legal and ethical standards. Of equal, if not greater importance is a framework that ensures that policy  decisions on the design and deployment of AI systems are made in systematised way, and that  unlawful or harmful AI systems never enter into public service. Member States that deploy AI systems  for criminal justice purposes should have regulatory mechanisms that are fit for purpose. At a  minimum, these should include frameworks for: a) pre-deployment impact assessments; b) post deployment monitoring and evaluations; and c) collection of data needed for effective comparative  analysis.  
Pre-Deployment 
Both the GDPR and LED recognise the need for AI systems to be analysed before they are deployed,  so that they comply with existing regulatory and human rights standards. Under Article 35 GDPR,  Member States are required to carry out a ‘Data Protection Impact Assessment’ (‘DPIA’) for data  processing systems that carry out ‘a systematic and extensive evaluation of personal aspects relating  to natural persons which is based on automated processing, including profiling and on which decision  are based that produce legal effects concerning the natural person or similarly significantly affect the  natural person’. The corresponding provision in the LED is Article 27, which similarly calls for DPIAs to  be carried out where processing of data is likely to result in a ‘high risk to the rights and freedoms of  natural persons’. DPIAs under both laws have to carry out inter alia an assessment of the possible  impact of the data processing system on the rights or individuals, and they need to mention what  measures will be in place to ensure that their rights are properly protected.  
DPIAs help to address a serious accountability challenge, but EU laws do not provide sufficiently  helpful standards on how they should be conducted. Article 27 LED does not lay down minimum  requirements for how DPIAs should be carried out. On the other hand, there are aspects of Article 35  GDPR which, if used to guide how DPIAs should be conducted for AI systems used in criminal justice,  would raise concerns. The foremost challenge is the level of transparency mandated by the GDPR.  DPIAs are envisaged largely as internal processes led by the data controller, who may seek the opinions  of data subjects (such as members of the public or their representatives), where it is ‘appropriate’ to  do so. The GDPR also explicitly recognises that the requirement to seek the views of data subject is  ‘without prejudice to the protection of commercial interests’.114 
As outlined above, transparency is a key aspect of a fair criminal justice system and, as a general rule,  all criminal justice decision-making processes need to be open to public scrutiny. There is no reason  why AI systems should be exempt from this requirement and, given that administration of criminal  justice is a matter of strong public interest, the public should have the right to voice their opinions and  raise objections whenever AI systems impact criminal justice processes. Also, given the highly  technical nature of AI systems, and their (as yet) poorly understood impact on society, impact  assessments must have multi-disciplinary expert engagement. 115 In particular, DPIAs should always  involve independent experts (computer scientists, in particular) who can audit, analyse, and if  possible, ‘explain’ AI systems, so that they can help legal, policy and social science experts to  determine the likely implications for the individuals’ rights. 

For public and expert consultations to be meaningful and effective, sufficient information should be  made available to interested parties so that the AI system can be thoroughly understood and  researched. Partnership on AI has recommended that for criminal justice risk-assessment tools,  training datasets,116 architectures and algorithms of AI systems should be made available to ensure  meaningful scrutiny.117 Commercial interests should not be regarded as a legitimate ground for  limiting the disclosure of this information.  
Secondly, Article 35 GDPR allows data controllers to carry out a single DPIA ‘for a set of similar  processing operations that present similar high risks’. There is a danger that this provision could be  interpreted too broadly if Member States are given free rein to determine what two systems can be  regarded as sufficiently ‘similar’. There are risks in assuming that an AI system well-suited for use in a  particular context or within a particular geographic area will be equally useful in another. AI systems  built using data from one jurisdiction might not be able to reflect differences in, for example, law  enforcement culture and patterns of behaviour, laws and policies, and socio-demographic  characteristics of another jurisdiction.118 Sometimes, these differences can be seen in the same  country or even within the same region. For example, a study of ‘PRECOBS’ a predictive policing tool  used in Baden-Wurttemberg in Germany, found significant differences in predictive utility between  rural and urban areas.119 
Finally, DPIAs seem to require data controllers to theorise the possible impact of AI systems, but there  is no strict requirement for AI systems to be subject to testing or auditing before, or immediately after  deployment. This overlooks the fact that flaws in AI systems, including unintentional biases, are not  always easily detectable, and that they might only surface once the system is put into operation. As  discussed earlier, the causes of biases in AI systems can be difficult to identify, and it is difficult to  appreciate how, short of thorough testing, the true impact of AI decisions can be known.  
In New York, the AI Now Institute has proposed an alternative model for impact assessments, known  as ‘Algorithmic Impact Assessments’ (‘AIAs’).120 The AIA framework sets out in detail how public  authorities should conduct impact assessments of AI systems, and it can be contrasted with the  provisions of the GDPR in that AIAs place much greater emphasis on the need for community  engagement and consultations with external experts. This framework could serve as a useful guide for  Member States seeking to establish pre-deployment procedures for approving AI systems.  
AI systems should not be deployed unless they have undergone an independent public impact  assessment with the involvement of appropriate experts, that is specific both to the purpose for  which the AI system is deployed, and the locality where it is deployed. AI systems must be tested  for impact pre-deployment, and systems should be precluded from deployment until they have  undergone this testing and achieved minimum standards, such as non-discrimination. 
Post-Deployment 
Impact assessments of AI systems should not be regarded as ‘one-off’ processes. They have to be  followed up with ongoing post-deployment monitoring and evaluation, so that the longer-term impact of AI systems can be understood, and shortcomings and biases that affect the rights of  individuals can be identified and fixed.  
The ability of AI systems to deliver fair and just outcomes, and to meet policy objectives can be difficult  to predict from the outset. Although AI systems can be validated and tested prior to deployment to  check if they are likely to produce desired outcomes, their impact in the real world might be different.  Furthermore, even if the likely outputs of AI systems can be predicted, it is much harder to estimate  the likely impact they will have on human decision-making.121 
Further reviews of AI systems are also necessary because criminal justice systems and the societies in  which they operate change over time. A study in the United States, for example, theorises that many  pre-trial risk assessment tools might be making predictions based on historic data that is no longer fit  for purpose. It has been suggested that because data used to train risk assessment algorithms pre 
date bail reforms in many US jurisdictions, the impact of recent measures introduced to reduce the  risk of failure-to-appear, such as transportation assistance and text message alerts are not taken into  consideration – potentially leading to over-incarceration.122 Socio-demographic changes might also  require AI systems to be altered so that they continue to be fit for purpose. If, for example, an area  experiences high levels of net migration which results in rapid changes to policing patterns and judicial  behaviour, AI systems might need to be reviewed to make sure they are not unintentionally worsening  racial discrimination.  
Data Collection 
It is difficult to imagine how the impact of AI systems can be assessed, if there is inadequate data to  support effective monitoring. The deficiency of criminal justice data across the EU has been subject to  criticism. In particular, Fair Trials has found that most EU Member States do not systemically collect  statistics on the duration of pre-trial detention, outcomes of criminal cases of pre-trial detainees, and  the likelihood of a suspect or accused person being released by the court.123 The data needed for  effective monitoring and evaluation depends on the function of the AI system and its intended  objectives, but the lack of criminal justice data more generally questions whether Member States  currently have adequate legal and policy foundations for introducing AI systems responsibly into  criminal justice processes. Data needed for monitoring and evaluation purposes will, of course, need  to have been collected from well before the introduction of the AI system, so that a proper pre- and  post- analysis comparison can be made.  
Of particular concern is that in most EU Member States, race or ethnic data on criminal justice is not  available, either because there is no systemised process for collecting it, or because local laws ban this  practice altogether.124 This is a serious challenge because the most predominant criticism against the  use of AI systems in the United States and elsewhere is that it worsens racial and ethnic bias in criminal  justice decisions. Even without official statistics, there is strong evidence in many EU Member States  that certain ethnic minorities, and in particular, Roma and people of colour are unfairly  overrepresented in criminal justice systems.125 It is worrying that AI systems might worsen this  discrimination, but that there will be no way of detecting this trend, because of the lack of data.  

Furthermore, the absence of racial and ethnic data could also prevent pre-emptive measures to  combat racial bias. It is doubtful that developers will be able to design systems free from racial bias, if  they have no data against which to measure their performance.  
On data collection, Fair Trials believe that EU and its Member States will need to make a strict choice.  Either they should ensure that racially disaggregated criminal justice data is collected, or AI systems  should be banned where they make individualised assessments for criminal justice purposes. 
Effective monitoring of AI systems is not possible unless there is sufficient data that makes it  possible to discern their real impact. In particular, Member States need to collect data that allow  them to identify discriminatory impacts of AI systems, including discrimination on the basis of race  and ethnicity.

What are some examples of visible and hidden biases that have been observed in criminal justice AI? ","Some examples of visible and hidden biases observed in criminal justice AI include:

**Visible Biases:**
*   The 'Crime Anticipation System' ('CAS') in the Netherlands was initially designed to consider ethnicity as a relevant factor, using the number of 'non-Western allochtones' (individuals with at least one foreign-born parent) as an indicator for crime (Executive Summary, Part 1, AI systems should be designed to be non-discriminatory).
*   The Harm Assessment Risk Tool ('HART') in the United Kingdom included data from a private company that classified individuals into groups with blatantly racialized categories, such as 'Asian Heritage', which stereotyped individuals of 'Asian' origin as unemployed or having low-paid jobs (Executive Summary, Part 1, AI systems should be designed to be non-discriminatory).
*   In Denmark, an algorithmic assessment has classified neighborhoods as 'ghettos' based on criteria including if the levels of first and second-generation migrants in the population exceed 50%, leading to higher punishments for crimes in those areas (Executive Summary, Part 1, AI systems should be designed to be non-discriminatory).

**Hidden Biases:**
*   The COMPAS risk-assessment tool in the United States, which does not explicitly include race or ethnicity as a variable, was found to be 77% more likely to rate black defendants as 'high-risk' than white defendants, and almost twice as likely to mislabel white defendants as lower risk (Executive Summary, Part 1, AI systems should be designed to be non-discriminatory).
*   AI systems built on data from within the criminal justice system, such as policing or crime records, can reflect structural biases and inequalities. For example, in the UK, black people are over 9 times more likely to be stopped and searched and more than 3 times more likely to be arrested than white people. The National Data Analytics Solution ('NDAS') relies on stop and search data, leading to an overrepresentation of black people and inflated risk levels for them (Executive Summary, Part 1, AI systems should be designed to be non-discriminatory).
*   Biases can arise through the use of proxies, where seemingly legitimate data classifications act as surrogates for protected characteristics. For instance, home addresses or postcodes can be proxies for race or ethnicity. HART initially trained to find correlations between home addresses and the risk of reoffending, inadvertently linking ethnic origin and risk due to ethnic residential segregation (Executive Summary, Part 1, AI systems should be designed to be non-discriminatory). Roma are particularly vulnerable to this form of proxy discrimination (Executive Summary, Part 1, AI systems should be designed to be non-discriminatory).","It's quite concerning how artificial intelligence systems, despite their perceived impartiality, can actually generate and reinforce discriminatory and unjust outcomes within criminal justice. The document highlights both ""visible"" and ""hidden"" biases that have been observed in these systems.

Let's break them down:

### Visible Biases

These are biases that are explicitly designed into the system or are very obvious in the criteria used:

*   **Explicit Ethnic/Racial Categories in Predictive Policing (Netherlands):** The ""Crime Anticipation System"" (CAS) used in the Netherlands initially considered the number of ""non-Western allochtones"" (individuals with at least one foreign-born parent from a non-Western country) as a factor for predicting crime likelihood in an area. This directly linked ethnicity to crime.
*   **Racialized Socio-Demographic Categories (UK):** The Harm Assessment Risk Tool (HART) in the UK relied on a ""Mosaic"" code developed by a consumer credit reporting company. This code categorized individuals into groups based on factors like ethnic origin, income, and education. Some categories were blatantly racialized, such for example, stereotyping individuals of ""Asian Heritage"" as unemployed or having low-paid jobs.
*   **""Ghetto"" Classification Based on Migrant Population (Denmark):** Denmark's algorithmic assessment classified neighborhoods as ""ghettos"" based on criteria including unemployment, crime rates, and whether the levels of first and second-generation migrants exceeded 50%. These neighborhoods were then subjected to harsher measures, like higher punishments for crimes, clearly penalizing people based on where they live and their background.
*   **Over-criminalization Bias (UK):** HART was deliberately calibrated to ""err on the side of caution,"" meaning it regarded under-estimations of risk as more serious errors than over-estimations. This design predisposed the system to over-criminalize individuals by making it less likely for them to be deemed eligible for diversion programs, directly conflicting with the legal principle of ""in dubio reo"" (any doubt in a criminal case should favor the defendant).

### Hidden Biases

These biases are more insidious, often arising even when the AI system doesn't explicitly use protected characteristics like race or ethnicity. They typically stem from biased training data or the use of proxies:

*   **Discriminatory Outcomes Despite ""Race-Blind"" Design (US):** The COMPAS risk-assessment tool in the US, used to predict reoffending likelihood, did not include race or ethnicity as a variable. However, studies found it was 77% more likely to rate black defendants as ""high-risk"" than white defendants, and almost twice as likely to mislabel white defendants as lower risk. The bias emerged despite an apparent lack of explicit racial input.
*   **Biased Training Data from Law Enforcement Records:** AI systems in criminal justice heavily rely on existing criminal justice data (e.g., police and crime records). This data doesn't reflect actual criminality but rather ""records of policing""—showing where, how, and whom law enforcement *polices*. If policing patterns are discriminatory (e.g., disproportionate stop-and-searches against certain ethnic groups), the AI systems ""learn"" these biases, reinforcing and re-entrenching them.
    *   **Example (UK NDAS):** The National Data Analytics Solution (NDAS) relies on stop-and-search data. Given that black people are over 9 times more likely to be stopped and searched than white people in the UK, NDAS inevitably overrepresents black individuals and inflates their risk levels.
    *   **Example (UK Gangs Matrix):** This database, containing information on alleged ""gang"" members, showed that 78% of those on the matrix were black, highlighting a clear disproportionate impact stemming from the underlying data.
*   **Proxies for Protected Characteristics:** AI systems can inadvertently establish links between seemingly neutral variables and protected characteristics due to societal patterns.
    *   **Example (Home Addresses/Postcodes):** HART initially found correlations between home addresses/postcodes and reoffending risk. In countries with pronounced ethnic residential segregation, this can indirectly link ethnic origin to risk. Roma communities, often living in segregated areas, are particularly vulnerable to this form of proxy discrimination.
*   **Bias in Post-Trial Assessment Tools (UK):** The Offender Assessment System (OASys) in England and Wales, which assesses reoffending risk and offender needs, was found to generate different predictions based on race and gender, with better predictive validity for white offenders than for Asian, black, or mixed ethnicity offenders.
*   **Profiling Based on Associations (Netherlands):** The ProKid 12-SI tool assesses the risk of criminality in 12-year-olds using existing police data. It can deem children higher risk based on their relationships with ""high-risk"" individuals like siblings or friends, or even their parents' assessed risk, essentially judging them by association rather than individual actions.

These examples clearly demonstrate that even with good intentions, AI systems in criminal justice are susceptible to both overt and subtle biases, which can severely impact individuals' rights and perpetuate systemic inequalities. This underscores the urgent need for robust regulatory frameworks, rigorous testing, and transparent oversight."

2.2.2 Harsh and unfair consumer credit contract terms
130. Consumer credit contracts (loans) may include all kinds of harsh and unfair terms.
These may include-
 allowance for the lender to repossess property without sufficient warning or
time to remedy a default;
 large early termination fees if a loan is repaid early or the borrower is late in
paying the loan instalments; or
 placing security over property with greater value than the borrower‘s liability
under the consumer credit contract.
131. Laws in some countries allow a borrower to apply to a court or tribunal to ask them
to strike out the harsh and unfair contract terms.
132. The Malaysian Financial Services Act and the Islamic Financial Services Act
prohibit lenders (ie Financial Service Providers) from engaging in conduct that is
deemed to be inherently unfair to financial consumers. The types of prohibited
business conduct are set out in Schedule 7 of the two Acts. The types of conduct
that are prohibited include-
 providing borrowers with misleading or deceptive information;
 intimidating or exploiting borrowers;
 restricting the freedom of borrowers to choose between financial services or
products available to them;
 engaging in collusive business practices
Schedule 7 Malaysian Financial Services Act and Islamic Financial Services Act
Prohibited business conduct includes:
1. Engaging in conduct that is misleading or deceptive, or is likely to mislead or
deceive in relation to the nature, features, terms or price of any financial service or
product.
2. Inducing or attempting to induce a financial consumer to do an act or omit to do
an act in relation to any financial service or product by—
 making a statement, illustration, promise, forecast or comparison which is
misleading, false or deceptive;
 dishonestly concealing, omitting or providing material facts in a manner which
is ambiguous; or
 recklessly making any statement, illustration, promise, forecast or comparison
which is misleading, false or deceptive.

133. In Australia, a court can reopen a contract that is ‗unjust‘. ‗Unjust‘ conduct means
conduct that is ‗unconscionable, harsh or oppressive‘. This includes
circumstances in which the terms of the document are unjust, or the lender‘s
conduct is unjust.
134. In determining whether the contract was unjust, the court may take into account:
 whether the lender or any other person used unfair pressure;
 whether, at the time the contract was entered into, the lender knew or should
have known that the borrower would be unable to pay; or
 the annual percentage interest rates charged in comparable cases.
135. If the court decides that the contract is unjust, then it can make order a number of
remedies, including:
 reopening an account already taken between the parties;
 relieving the borrower and any guarantor from payment of any amount that
the court considers to be excessive;
 setting aside either wholly or in part or revise or alter an agreement made
or mortgage given in connection with the transaction; or
 ordering that the mortgagee takes such steps as are necessary
to discharge the mortgage.

USER REQUEST:
A lender applied a lien on a customer's house due to non-payment under their credit terms for a 100k loan (the lien was for the outstanding balance, around 80k). The property was inherited, so the customer paid nothing for the property (now worth more than a million AUD). Is this unfair, or predatory lending?","Consumer credit contracts may include harsh and unfair terms, such as placing security over property with greater value than the borrower's liability under the contract (Paragraph 130). In the described scenario, a lien for an outstanding balance of 80k was applied to a property worth over 1 million AUD, which aligns with this description (Paragraph 130). The document does not explicitly use the term ""predatory lending"" to describe this specific scenario.","That's a really insightful question, and the document provides some excellent context to help us think through it, especially since you've mentioned the property value in AUD, pointing towards Australian legal considerations.

Let's break it down:

1.  **Disproportionate Security as a ""Harsh and Unfair Term"" (General Principle):**
    The document explicitly states in paragraph 130 that ""placing security over property with greater value than the borrower‘s liability under the consumer credit contract"" can be considered a harsh and unfair term. In your scenario, the outstanding liability is around $80,000, while the security (the house) is worth well over a million AUD. This is a clear instance where the value of the security is significantly higher than the debt, which the document identifies as a potential problem.

2.  **Australian Law: ""Unjust"" Contracts:**
    Since you mentioned AUD, it's worth looking at the Australian context provided. In Australia, a court can reopen a contract that is deemed ""unjust"" (paragraph 133). ""Unjust"" conduct is defined as ""unconscionable, harsh or oppressive."" This applies not only to the terms of the contract but also to the lender's conduct.

    To determine if the contract or the lender's actions were ""unjust,"" a court would consider several factors (paragraph 134):
    *   **Unfair Pressure:** Was the customer subjected to any unfair pressure when signing the loan agreement? (Not explicitly stated in your scenario, but important to consider).
    *   **Lender's Knowledge of Inability to Pay:** This is a crucial point for determining if the lending was potentially predatory. Did the lender know, or *should they have known*, at the time the $100,000 loan was given, that the borrower would likely be unable to repay it? If a lender grants a loan they know a borrower can't afford, especially with high-value security, it points towards predatory practices.
    *   **Interest Rates:** Were the annual percentage interest rates reasonable compared to similar loans?

3.  **Is it ""Predatory Lending""?**
    While the document doesn't use the exact phrase ""predatory lending,"" the concept of an ""unjust"" contract in Australia (being ""unconscionable, harsh or oppressive"") certainly aligns with what many would consider predatory.
    *   The fact that the property was inherited and the customer paid nothing for it, while relevant to the customer's personal circumstances, doesn't automatically make the lien unfair from a contractual perspective *unless* the loan itself was unjustly provided. Lenders typically assess the value of collateral to mitigate their risk, and inherited property holds the same value as purchased property in that regard.
    *   However, if the lender provided a relatively small loan ($100k) to someone they *knew* or *should have known* couldn't afford it, while securing it against a multi-million dollar asset, then that could very well be seen as a predatory practice, exploiting the borrower's vulnerability and the disproportionate security.

**In conclusion:**

Based on the document, the situation where a lender places a lien on a house worth over a million AUD for an $80,000 outstanding debt is a classic example of **disproportionate security**, which the document explicitly lists as a potentially ""harsh and unfair consumer credit contract term"" (paragraph 130).

Whether this constitutes outright **predatory lending** or an **""unjust"" contract** under Australian law would depend on additional factors, primarily:

*   **The lender's conduct at the time the loan was issued:** Did they responsibly assess the borrower's ability to repay the $100k loan, or did they deliberately lend to someone they knew couldn't afford it, relying on the valuable inherited property as disproportionate security?
*   **The specific terms of the loan agreement:** Were there any other unfair clauses, or was the process of placing the lien done without sufficient warning as mentioned in paragraph 130?

If the lending was irresponsible or exploitative from the outset, leading to this disproportionate lien, then yes, it could strongly be argued as both unfair and potentially predatory. If the loan was granted responsibly, and the lien is simply a consequence of a legitimate default under a contract with a harsh security term, then it's still unfair due to the disproportionate security, but perhaps not necessarily ""predatory"" in the sense of the lender intentionally setting up the borrower to fail."

Class 1: The Purpose of the Corporation (Dodge v. Ford Motor Company)
Dodge v. Ford Motor Company is a great case. It is important because its ruling touches on a
question at the very core of corporate law: what is the purpose of the corporation? Is it exclusively
to make the most money for shareholders? (And if so – making the most money long-term or short-
term?) Or perhaps it is also permissible – or even required – that the corporation would act in the
interests of other stakeholders – employees, creditors, customers, the local community, or the
nation in which it is incorporated?
But there is another reason why Dodge v. Ford Motor Company is a great case: the parties are
pretending to act for reasons different than those that really motivate them. As we will see in class,
the plaintiff and defendant present their interests in ways that don’t make sense once you think
things through. And read narrowly, the court’s decision seems almost arbitrary and in contrast to
established law. But once you understand the entire context, the court ruling can be seen as a
clever way to maintain both the letter and the spirit of established law.
But no case is perfect. The main weakness of Dodge is that it is not well-written; indeed, it is quite
boring to read. Another weakness is that the actual legal question it discusses is a narrow one that
requires knowing some corporate law to understand. Therefore, though I am including the text of
the case for you to read ahead of class, it is not the main assignment and you should not feel
frustrated if it’s not clear to you. I will explain the case in class.
Rather, the main reading assignment ahead of class is an excerpt from an old magazine article,
about an economist you may never have heard about – Friedrich List. I think this is a more
enjoyable reading, and it will give you background for a discussion on the big policy question
Dodge tackles: whose interests should the corporation serve?
No doubt you have heard of Adam Smith and later classical economists who espoused free-market
economics, based on the idea that self-interested behavior by market participants enriches society
as a whole. The line of corporate law doctrine that fits with this worldview is the norm that a
corporation should operate solely for the purpose of its shareholders, and that this would ultimately
benefit all other stakeholders (employees, customers, society as a whole, etc.).
Friedrich List is a leading intellectual force behind an opposing view, which is why I ask that you
read the article to understand the main differences between his world view and that of his free-
market opponents (which he called the “cosmopolitans”). While List is not widely known today,
his work is credited with influencing the thinking of several policy makers and leaders, including
China’s Deng Xiaoping.
In some ways, List appears more relevant to political debate today – with the rise of populist
politicians in several countries including the U.S. – than it was when the article was written. But
in other ways, this article is very much a product of its time. To a contemporary reader it may
appear odd how much Japan and Germany are mentioned in the article compared to other countries
(for example, China). But this was very typical of American policy analysis (and popular culture)
in the 1980s. At that time, the American economy was relatively stagnant, while the economies
of Japan and Germany were booming. The US had a large trade deficit with these countries, with
cheaper German and Japanese imports crowding out a shrinking American industry, and German
and Japanese firms used the dollars they acquired from the deficit to acquire iconic American
assets. The result was fear of those two countries on one hand, and a desire to mimic them on the
other hand. The article is in the tail end of that trend; by the 1990s Japan entered a prolonged
recession, the German economy slowed under the costs of the reunification of West and East
Germany, and the American economy prospered again. You may be more familiar with a
reincarnation of this trend, in the 2000s and early 2010s, this time focused on China.

Use the text provided to explain the difference between Adam Smith's economic philosophy and that of Friedrich List.","Adam Smith and later classical economists espoused free-market economics, which is based on the idea that self-interested behavior by market participants enriches society as a whole (Class 1: The Purpose of the Corporation). This worldview aligns with the corporate law norm that a corporation should operate solely for the purpose of its shareholders, which would ultimately benefit all other stakeholders (Class 1: The Purpose of the Corporation).

Friedrich List is a leading intellectual force behind an opposing view to these free-market opponents (Class 1: The Purpose of the Corporation). The document asks the reader to understand the main differences between List's worldview and that of his free-market opponents (Class 1: The Purpose of the Corporation).","It sounds like you're diving into some fascinating economic and corporate law discussions! The document highlights a key difference between Adam Smith and Friedrich List by placing them on opposite sides of a fundamental debate about how economies should function and what the ultimate purpose of a corporation should be.

Here's a breakdown of their philosophies based on the text:

*   **Adam Smith's Economic Philosophy (and classical economists):**
    *   **Core Idea:** Smith is a champion of **free-market economics**. His core belief, often summarized by the idea of an ""invisible hand,"" is that when individuals and market participants act out of their own self-interest, it ultimately leads to the greatest enrichment and benefit for society as a whole.
    *   **Corporate Purpose:** In line with this, the corporate law doctrine stemming from Smith's worldview suggests that a corporation's primary, if not sole, purpose should be to **maximize profits for its shareholders**. The belief is that by focusing on shareholder wealth, the corporation will inherently create benefits that trickle down to all other stakeholders—like employees, customers, and the broader community.

*   **Friedrich List's Opposing View:**
    *   **Core Idea:** List stands as a leading intellectual force *against* Smith's free-market approach. While the document doesn't fully detail List's philosophy, it characterizes it as an ""opposing view"" to the idea that self-interested behavior automatically enriches everyone. He was critical of what he called Smith's ""cosmopolitans"" (those advocating for purely free, global markets).
    *   **Implied Corporate Purpose/Economic Focus:** Given that List's work is presented as the counterpoint to Smith on the question of ""whose interests should the corporation serve?"", it strongly implies that List's philosophy advocates for corporations (and national economies) to consider a broader range of interests beyond just shareholders. This might include employees, local communities, or national economic development, rather than purely relying on free-market forces. The text also notes his relevance to the rise of ""populist politicians,"" who often prioritize national or collective interests over purely global free-market principles.

**In essence, the main difference boils down to this:**

*   **Smith** believed in the power of individual self-interest within a free market to drive overall societal prosperity, and that corporations should serve shareholders first.
*   **List** presented a counter-argument, suggesting a different approach where potentially national interests or a broader set of stakeholders' well-being might take precedence over unbridled free-market individualism and sole shareholder profit.

It's clear that understanding List helps provide a crucial intellectual framework for discussing the complex policy question of a corporation's true purpose!"

**The Holiday Dip**
According to the National Retail Federation, it is
not uncommon for retailers to bring in 20-40% of
their annual sales during the weeks leading up
to Christmas. Key shopping days such as Cyber
Monday and Black Friday are so important that
even those outside the industry watch to see
what happens and
plan their shopping
around these days.
A unique challenge
for retail customer
service organizations
is dealing with this sudden and temporary
increase in volume of sales transactions while
maintaining customer satisfaction levels, all while
dealing with the reality of budget constraints.
To add to the
challenge of pure
volume faced during
the holiday season,
teams must deal with
customers that can
be more difficult than
usual. They are often more unpleasant because of
stress, make purchase decisions less thoughtfully,
and have less experience with retail processes
such as coupons and returns.
THE ”HOLIDAY DIP“
Ellen, the manager of a small customer service
team at a company selling personal hygiene
products, emphasized that the holiday rush is
about much more than pure volume for her team.
“Yes, we’re busy in Q4. But what is worse is the
customers are different. They are more stressed
and we have to up the
positive energy to calm
them down. But we can’t
take more time with
customers since they are
all just as busy as we are.
People are buying less thoughtfully so there are
more purchase regrets and returns that we have
to deal with.” Adam echoed this sentiment.
“During the holidays we find we get a large
number of customers that just aren’t shoppers.
They don’t know things that
we expect most people know
like finding the return label in
the box or using the coupon
before they pay.”
The Zendesk Benchmark has
tracked the impact of the holiday rush on customer
satisfaction. There is a clear trend: satisfaction
with customer service interactions measurably
and consistently drop during the holiday season.
 “Q4 is our busiest time of year, and every
parameter that impacts a successful
customer experience is strained.”
“During the holidays, customers don’t
understand how things work as well as our
typical customer. We have to spend more
time on education and misunderstandings
at a time when we’re busy anyway.”

Q4
The Zendesk analysis further drilled down into
the data to examine the cause of this “dip” in
satisfaction during the holiday season. They
found a clear correlation between the drop in
satisfaction and the number of tickets per
agent. As tickets per agent increased,
satisfaction decreased.
The retail customer service managers we
spoke with agreed that the Q4 satisfaction dip
is a significant issue. They frequently described
planning for the holiday rush as one of the most
strategic activities they do each year. Pelle, the
director of customer service for a company
selling fashion accessories, had just finished
his annual performance review when we spoke.
“If I look back at last year, my biggest strategic
mistake was my Q4 forecast. I got it wrong and
my team wasn’t ready. We’re already making
changes to do better this year.”
Pelle’s approach for the coming holiday season
included an investment in a customer service
platform that will enable more self-service
capabilities and streamline workflow so each
agent can handle more tickets. This option was
a good choice since he had time to implement
and test the systems and train his agents well
before the Q4 rush started.
Lucia took a different approach to dealing with
the holiday customer service rush. She brought
on an outsourcing partner for the holiday season.
This was a good option for her company, which
sells non-perishable food items, as agents do
not require additional product expertise. Their
company has used this approach for several
years, and each time they optimize the way
they work together to create a more seamless
experience. “We have a great outsourcing
Customer Service in the Retail Revolution 06
partner, and having them deal with basic issues
like shipping, let us focus on the things that
are unique to our business. However, when we
first started working together we operated too
independently. Tickets that were escalated from
the outsourcer to us created a real speed-bump
for the customers as they were passed up the
chain. We invested in a service platform that
allowed us to buy temporary licenses for the
outsourcer so we are all on the same system all
the time. That eliminated that problem, plus gave
us greater insight into what was going on with the
outsourcer. For example, we were able to identify
a quality problem with one outsourcing agent
that was just not the kind of person we wanted
representing our company.”
Clay, director of call center operations at a
furniture and appliance chain based in Australia,
chose to hire additional permanent staff for
the holiday season. While this was the most
expensive option available, his company’s large
ticket items made a focus on personal contact
very important and made this the best option.
Claire, who works for a Scandinavian electronics
retailer, deals with the Q4 rush by temporarily
assigning responsibilities of staff outside of
the regular customer service team. “During
the holiday season, nothing is as important as
ensuring sales are made. From our CEO to the
teenager who cleans the kitchen, we were all
working the service queue last December. I know
this wouldn’t work everywhere. We have a small
company with people who are willing to pitch in
and do whatever it takes. We are very careful
to have procedures and training in place so we
don’t end up creating more work cleaning up
mistakes made by employees who usually aren’t
customer facing.”
Clearly, there is no single “right way” for retailers
preparing for the holiday rush. What is never an
option is to simply hope that existing resources
can manage when activity increases dramatically.
However, there are two important strategies that
work well for all customer service managers:
Be ready early:
Experienced managers who have been
through many holiday seasons consistently
recommend having all additional resources
in place one month before the rush starts.
This gives the opportunity to have everyone
trained, all processes in place, and all hiccups
ironed out before the real rush begins and it
becomes complicated to make changes.
Use data to influence management:
Customer service teams who have been
through a bad year usually have an easier
time convincing their management to invest
in resources for the next year. Using data
from prior years, such as ticket volumes and
customer satisfaction trends, combined with
resources like the Zendesk Benchmark can
be very influential in having management
approve customer service investments for Q4.

Why does satisfaction with customer service interactions decline around the holidays?","Satisfaction with customer service interactions declines around the holidays due to several factors. The Zendesk analysis found a clear correlation between the drop in satisfaction and the number of tickets per agent; as tickets per agent increased, satisfaction decreased (Customer Service in the Retail Revolution 05).

Additionally, the holiday season presents unique challenges for customer service, leading to strained experiences:
*   There is a sudden and temporary increase in the volume of sales transactions (The Holiday Dip).
*   Customers can be more difficult, stressed, and unpleasant than usual, making purchase decisions less thoughtfully (The Holiday Dip; THE ”HOLIDAY DIP“).
*   Customers often have less experience with retail processes like coupons and returns (The Holiday Dip; THE ”HOLIDAY DIP“).
*   Customer service teams must deal with more purchase regrets and returns (THE ”HOLIDAY DIP“).
*   Customers may not know basic information, such as finding return labels or using coupons (THE ”HOLIDAY DIP“).
*   ""Every parameter that impacts a successful customer experience is strained"" during this time (Customer Service in the Retail Revolution 05).
*   Customer service teams have to spend more time on education and misunderstandings, even though they are already busy (Customer Service in the Retail Revolution 05).","It's a phenomenon retailers know all too well: the ""Holiday Dip"" in customer satisfaction. This decline in service satisfaction during the festive season is a consistent trend, and the document highlights several key reasons why it happens:

1.  **Massive Increase in Volume:** The weeks leading up to Christmas account for a significant portion (20-40%) of a retailer's annual sales. This sudden and temporary surge means a huge increase in sales transactions and, consequently, customer service inquiries. Customer service teams are simply swamped with a much higher number of tickets, straining their resources to the limit.

2.  **More Stressed and Less Experienced Customers:**
    *   **Increased Stress:** Customers themselves are often under more stress during the holidays, which can make them more unpleasant to deal with. Customer service teams have to work harder to ""up the positive energy to calm them down.""
    *   **Less Thoughtful Purchases:** People tend to make purchase decisions less thoughtfully, leading to more ""purchase regrets and returns"" that the customer service team has to handle.
    *   **""Not Shoppers"":** Many holiday customers aren't regular shoppers and lack basic retail process knowledge. As one manager put it, ""They don't know things that we expect most people know like finding the return label in the box or using the coupon before they pay."" This means agents spend more time educating customers and dealing with misunderstandings.

3.  **Strain on Agents and Decreased Efficiency:** The Zendesk Benchmark analysis found a clear correlation: as the ""number of tickets per agent increased, satisfaction decreased."" This makes perfect sense – when agents are dealing with significantly more inquiries, they have less time to dedicate to each customer. This is compounded by the need to spend more time on education and resolving misunderstandings with less experienced, more stressed customers, all while trying to maintain efficiency.

In essence, the holiday season creates a perfect storm: a massive increase in demand, a more challenging customer base, and finite resources. These factors combine to put immense pressure on customer service teams, often leading to longer wait times, less personalized interactions, and ultimately, a measurable drop in overall customer satisfaction. That's why many experienced managers consider planning for the holiday rush one of their most strategic annual activities!"

From top to bottom, IoT devices enhance the development of concepts like smart home, smart vehicle, smart agriculture (Pranto et al. 2021), smart health care, communication, cybersecurity and many more systems (Haque et al. 2021a). They have been used to conduct, monitor, and produce reactions based on the information gathered. People have been thinking of connecting devices to the Internet for a long time. The Internet of Things, on the other hand, enhances and extends network technology based on existing internet technology, allowing computing and smart objects to connect and communicate with one another. The IoT can be broadly defined as any object that communicates, produces, and interchanges data with other objects via the Internet to perform orientation tracing, tracking, intelligent recognition, and management. This process is conducted by various sensors or peripherals such as GPS, thermal sensors, RFID, etc. (Yang et al. 2011).
 

 Characteristics of IoT
 There are many functional and non-functional IoT needs for creating the infrastructure. We will discuss some of the most valuable characteristics of IoT here.
 

 Availability
 To provide customers with facilities wherever and whenever they need them, IoT availability must be implemented at the hardware and software levels. The capacity of IoT systems to give functionality to anybody in any location is referred to as software availability (Mistry et al. 2020a). The nature of computers that are always compatible with IoT features and protocols is referred to as hardware availability. To allow IoT capabilities, protocols like IPv6, 6LoWPAN, RPL, CoAP, and others need to be implemented inside the restricted devices of the single board resource. One technique for achieving high IoT service availability is to ensure the availability of critical hardware and facilities (Bahalul Haque 2019).
 

 Mobility
 Although most utilities are designed to be delivered via Smartphone devices, IoT implementation is hampered by accessibility. A key IoT premise is to keep customers connected to their preferred resources when moving. When mobile devices are relocated from one gateway to another, service interruptions may occur. Caching and tunneling for service continuity allow apps to access IoT data even if the internet is down for a short time. The vast number of smart devices available in IoT systems is usually included in any solid framework for mobility control.
 

 Scalability
 Scalability in the Internet of Things refers to the ability to accept new client equipment, software, and capabilities without compromising the efficiency of existing systems. It is not straightforward to add new processes and manage extra devices, especially when there are several hardware platforms and communication protocols to contend with. IoT applications must be built from the ground up to enable extendable services and operations.
 

 Security and Privacy
 On diverse networks, such as the Internet of Things, ensuring user security and privacy is strict. The fundamental functioning of the Internet of Things is built on data transmission between billions, if not trillions, of Internet-connected items. One great problem in IoT security left out of the standards is the key distribution between devices. The growing number of intelligent objects around us with sensitive data necessitates transparent and simple access control management, such as enabling one vendor to view the data. In contrast, another controls the device 
 

 Performance
 The performance of IoT services is difficult to evaluate since it is based on the performance of many components and the underlying technology. The Internet of Things, like other programs, must constantly develop and expand its offerings in order to meet user expectations. 
 

 IoT also needs to manage the larger amount of information or data created in the ecosystem, ensuring the interoperability and quality of service.
 

 Layered Architecture of IoT
 Various designs have been suggested for IoT worlds. In general, such structures are divided into three categories. There are three types of architecture: three-layer architecture, four-layer architecture, and five-layer architecture. In this chapter, we will look at the three-layered architecture. It is organized keeping mid some specific tasks to accomplish by the system like executing service functions, transmitting data, and connection among service devices. It results in three layers, Application layer, Network/Transmission layer, and Perception/Edge layer.
 

 Application Layer
 In different implementations, this layer may include various services. Smart grids, healthcare, and autonomous automobiles are examples of IoT deployment in smart cities and homes. Because the application layer might serve as a service support middleware, a networking standard, or a cloud computing platform, security considerations vary depending on the application's environment and industry.
 

 Network Layer
 Acting as a bridge, the network layer controls data transfer to subsequent layers. This layer connects to the visual layer. Different smart devices are connected to the network layer following control function protocol (IEEE 802.x) and authentication standards (GPS, and Near-Field Connectivity (NFC)). The transmission of data is highly prone to cyber-attacks. Intelligent intrusion detection key encryption with secured management-based IoT security framework is the most popular along with the latest adoption of blockchain technology.
 

 Edge Layer
 Edge layer manages the IoT devices or sensors like RFID, different actuators, cameras, intensity detectors, moisture and pressure sensors, etc., using gateways in a coordinating function to connect with Researchers have proposed security solutions for this layer based on machine learning, multi-stepped authorization, secure channeling through anti-malware, etc.
 

 Requirements for 5G Integrated IoT Architecture
 5G-enabled IoT needs special attention for its heterogeneity, advancement, and application. However, there are some requirements that all the architecture should follow (Li et al. 2018b):
 

 5G IoT must ensure a low latency of 1 ms considering the sensitive internet system and medical perspective.
 

 The architecture must ensure low energy consumption for low-battery life IoT devices but enough for 5G to transfer data.
 

 An advanced application like Virtual Reality or Augmented Reality needs a high speed of 25 Mbps, so the architecture must follow with the future needs.
 

 Security must be top-notch, considering massive data transmission at a very high speed.
 

 The devices with mobility factors will get priority for the 5G IoT infrastructure.
 

 The fundamental 5G IoT architecture consists of five steps in general: sensors, IoT Gateway, 5G-based station, cloud storage, and application (Arsh et al. 2021). These steps can be comprised in IoT layers to bring up a general 5G IoT architecture.
 

 Edge Layer of 5G IoT
 The sensors and gateway of IoT can be comprised of 5G in this layer. For example, sensors for wearable ECG, temperature, smart manufacturing etc. will use this layer to transmit and process information using 5G technology (Shdefat et al. 2021).
 

 Network Layer of 5G IoT
 The network layer will hold the 5G base station and cloud storage to process data using IoT devices.
 

 Application Layer of 5G IoT
 The application layer will provide all the support for the end system like smart home, smart supply chain, etc. (Haque et al. 2021b).
 

 Following the above-mentioned general architecture, 5G IoT can support millimeter-wave (Rahimi et al. 2018), D2D communication, nano-chip, wireless software (Huang et al. 2020), mobile edge computing, data analytics cloud computing (Mudigonda et al. 2020), and many more technologies and application. In Fig. 11.1, we have shown a generalized architecture for the 5G integrated IoT ecosystem.
 

 

 Blockchain-Based 5G IoT
 Blockchain (Haque and Bhushan 2021b) can bring trust and improved security to 5G IoT. It can accelerate data exchange at a lower cost by implementing a cryptographic encryption system to the architecture. The immutability and accountability that blockchain can ensure for the system are marvelous (Hewa et al. 2020). Blockchain integrated 5G IoT can bring revolution to industrial IoT, UnThese layers work together using cloud storage and a 5G network to provide services like education, fire station, transportation, factories, etc.

Let's break down how this advanced architecture supports complex applications, the role of blockchain, and the crucial requirements for its success.

### How 5G IoT Architecture Supports Complex Applications

The 5G IoT architecture, with its distinct Edge, Network, and Application layers, is specifically designed to handle the demanding requirements of sophisticated applications like smart homes, virtual reality (VR), and industrial IoT (IIoT). Here’s how each layer contributes:

1.  **Edge Layer of 5G IoT:** This layer is where the ""things"" of IoT directly interact with the 5G network. It encompasses sensors (like those for wearable ECGs or in smart manufacturing) and IoT gateways.
    *   **For Complex Applications:** The edge layer's strength lies in its proximity to the data source. By integrating 5G technology here, data from countless sensors can be transmitted and pre-processed with incredibly low latency.
        *   **Smart Homes:** Imagine smart locks, security cameras, or climate control systems. The edge layer ensures immediate response times, like a door unlocking the moment you approach or lights turning on instantly.
        *   **Virtual Reality (VR):** VR experiences demand near-instantaneous feedback. The edge layer, utilizing 5G, can collect sensory data (e.g., from motion trackers) and even perform initial processing, minimizing the delay before it reaches the user, thus preventing motion sickness and enhancing immersion.
        *   **Industrial IoT:** In factories, real-time monitoring of machinery for predictive maintenance or immediate control of robotic arms is critical. The edge layer processes data from industrial sensors (temperature, pressure, vibration) with minimal delay, enabling quick decision-making and preventing costly downtime.

2.  **Network Layer of 5G IoT:** This layer is the backbone, housing the 5G base stations and cloud storage. It acts as the high-speed conduit and processing hub for the vast amounts of data generated by the edge layer.
    *   **For Complex Applications:** 5G's inherent capabilities—massive bandwidth, high speed, and ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC)—are fully leveraged here.
        *   **Smart Homes:** The network layer ensures seamless connectivity for all devices, enabling complex automation routines, remote control, and integration with broader smart city services by efficiently routing and storing data in the cloud.
        *   **Virtual Reality (VR):** For highly detailed VR environments or cloud-rendered VR, the network layer provides the necessary high-speed data transfer (up to 25 Mbps as mentioned for AR/VR), allowing complex graphics and computational tasks to be offloaded to the cloud without noticeable lag.
        *   **Industrial IoT:** This layer facilitates the aggregation of data from thousands of machines across an entire factory or supply chain. It enables powerful cloud-based analytics, machine learning for optimization, and secure communication between different industrial systems, supporting advanced applications like digital twins and automated logistics.

3.  **Application Layer of 5G IoT:** This is the top layer, providing all the user-facing support and services for end systems.
    *   **For Complex Applications:** This is where the raw data is transformed into actionable insights and intuitive user experiences.
        *   **Smart Homes:** This layer presents the user interface on your smartphone or smart display, allowing you to monitor and control all your home's devices, receive alerts, and manage complex schedules and automations (e.g., ""Good Morning"" routine).
        *   **Virtual Reality (VR):** The application layer delivers the actual VR content, whether it's an immersive game, a training simulation, or a virtual meeting space, leveraging the fast and low-latency data streams provided by the underlying layers.
        *   **Industrial IoT:** Here, dashboards for plant managers, analytics platforms for engineers, and interfaces for controlling entire production lines reside. It translates complex machine data into understandable metrics and enables strategic decision-making to optimize operations, improve efficiency, and ensure safety.

In essence, the 5G IoT architecture forms a powerful synergy: the Edge provides immediate, localized processing; the Network offers robust, high-speed, and low-latency connectivity; and the Application layer delivers intelligent, user-friendly services. This layered approach, combined with 5G's capabilities, is what allows such sophisticated and demanding applications to function effectively.

### How Blockchain Benefits 5G IoT Architecture for Security and Data Exchange

Blockchain technology is a game-changer for 5G IoT, primarily by addressing crucial concerns around security, trust, and efficient data exchange. Here's how it benefits the architecture:

1.  **Enhanced Security through Cryptographic Encryption:**
    *   Blockchain inherently uses cryptographic encryption to secure every transaction and data block. When integrated with 5G IoT, this means that data transmitted between devices, through the network layer, and stored in the cloud, can be more robustly encrypted and verified. This is crucial given the ""massive data transmission at a very high speed"" in 5G IoT, making it much harder for malicious actors to intercept or alter information.
    *   It helps solve the ""key distribution between devices"" problem mentioned in the document, by providing a decentralized and secure way to manage identities and access credentials for billions of IoT devices.

2.  **Immutability and Accountability:**
    *   One of blockchain's core features is immutability, meaning once data is recorded on the ledger, it cannot be changed or deleted. This creates an unalterable audit trail for all data exchanges and device interactions within the 5G IoT ecosystem.
    *   **Benefits:**
        *   **Trust:** In complex supply chains (like in IIoT), smart health care, or smart homes, knowing that sensor readings, device commands, or personal data records haven't been tampered with builds immense trust among all stakeholders and devices.
        *   **Accountability:** If an issue arises, blockchain allows for clear tracing of data origin and changes, making it easier to identify the source of a problem or a security breach. This accountability is ""marvelous"" for maintaining system integrity.

3.  **Accelerated and Lower-Cost Data Exchange:**
    *   Blockchain can streamline data exchange by creating a decentralized, peer-to-peer network for transactions. This can eliminate the need for centralized intermediaries, reducing overhead costs and potential single points of failure.
    *   **Benefits:**
        *   **Efficiency:** For high-volume data exchanges in 5G IoT, blockchain can facilitate faster and more secure transactions between devices or between devices and cloud services, accelerating data processing and decision-making.
        *   **Economic Advantage:** By reducing transaction costs and the need for extensive third-party verification, blockchain can make the overall operation of 5G IoT systems more economical, especially for micro-transactions or data sharing between numerous entities.

In summary, blockchain infuses 5G IoT with a layer of trust, transparency, and uncompromised security, transforming how data is exchanged and managed across this highly interconnected and often vulnerable environment.

### Critical Parameters for Effective Work and Security of 5G-Based IoT Systems

To ensure the effective operation and security of IoT systems leveraging 5G technology, several critical parameters must be meticulously met. These requirements are foundational to unlocking the full potential of 5G IoT:

1.  **Low Latency (1 ms):**
    *   **Effective Work:** This is paramount for applications requiring real-time responsiveness, such as autonomous vehicles, remote surgery (medical perspective), industrial automation, and immersive VR/AR experiences. A 1 ms latency ensures that commands are executed and feedback is received virtually instantaneously, preventing delays that could be critical for safety or performance.
    *   **Security:** While primarily a performance metric, extremely low latency can indirectly aid security by enabling quicker detection and response to anomalies or cyber-attacks.

2.  **Low Energy Consumption:**
    *   **Effective Work:** Many IoT devices are small, battery-powered, and deployed in remote or hard-to-reach locations. Ensuring low energy consumption is vital for extending their battery life and reducing maintenance costs, enabling widespread and sustainable IoT deployment, even while facilitating 5G data transfer.
    *   **Security:** Devices with prolonged battery life are less likely to experience power failures that could compromise their security state or communication integrity.

3.  **High Speed (e.g., 25 Mbps for AR/VR):**
    *   **Effective Work:** Advanced applications like virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) require massive amounts of data to be transmitted rapidly to render complex graphics and provide seamless, immersive experiences. High speed ensures that these data-intensive applications perform without buffering or lag, meeting user expectations.
    *   **Security:** High-speed data transfer isn't directly a security parameter, but it's essential for carrying the encrypted payloads and security protocols necessary for protecting data at scale.

4.  **Top-Notch Security:**
    *   **Effective Work & Security:** This is non-negotiable, given the ""massive data transmission at a very high speed"" and the sensitive nature of much of this data (e.g., personal health information, industrial control data). Top-notch security involves:
        *   **Robust Encryption:** Protecting data in transit and at rest.
        *   **Authentication and Authorization:** Ensuring only legitimate devices and users can access the network and specific resources.
        *   **Intrusion Detection and Prevention:** Constantly monitoring for and mitigating cyber threats, especially given the increased attack surface of billions of connected devices.
        *   **Privacy Protection:** Implementing mechanisms like access control management to ensure sensitive data is viewed only by authorized entities, as highlighted in the document.

5.  **Mobility Prioritization:**
    *   **Effective Work:** Many 5G IoT applications involve mobile devices (e.g., smart vehicles, drones, wearables). The architecture must prioritize and seamlessly manage these devices as they move between different network gateways without service interruptions. This ""service continuity"" (even with temporary internet outages via caching and tunneling) is crucial for applications where constant connectivity is essential.
    *   **Security:** Robust mobility management ensures that security policies and connections remain consistent as devices move, preventing potential vulnerabilities that could arise during handovers between network cells or access points.

By meticulously addressing these critical parameters, 5G IoT systems can deliver reliable, high-performance, and secure services across a vast array of applications, truly transforming our world."
"DOCUMENT:
On January 18, 2022, Microsoft Corp. announced plans to acquire Activision Blizzard Inc., a video game company, for $68.7 billion.1 The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is reviewing the acquisition,2 as provided under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act (HSR),3 to determine whether its effect might be “substantially to lessen competition”—a violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act. 4 Competition authorities in other countries are reviewing Microsoft’s proposed acquisition as well.5 The companies have said they expect to complete the acquisition before June 30, 2023.6 In recent decades, enforcement of antitrust laws has typically focused on how a proposed merger or acquisition might affect consumers, such as by reducing price competition in relevant product markets. Some of the FTC’s actions and statements over the last two years suggest that in its review of Microsoft’s proposed acquisition, the FTC may be considering other factors that are discussed in this report.7 This report discusses Microsoft’s proposed acquisition of Activision Blizzard, including some of the potential effects on existing product markets, labor markets, and on product markets that do not currently exist but may develop in the future. The report also provides some considerations for Congress, discussing some bills that may affect Microsoft’s proposed acquisition or Microsoft’s future behavior if the acquisition is completed.

The video game industry can be separated into three components:  developers or gaming studios that create and design video games;  publishers who market and monetize the video games; and distributors who provide the video games to consumers.8 Video games are most commonly played on game consoles, personal computers (PCs), and mobile devices (Figure 1). Although some retailers sell physical copies of video games for consoles and PCs, the majority of video games are sold in digital format;9 games for mobile devices are sold only in digital format

The extent of competition among distributors depends on the format and device used to play the game. The digital format of video games played on a console generally can only be downloaded from a digital store operated by the producer of the console. Games for PCs can be purchased from a selection of digital stores that are operated by various firms,10 including publishers and developers.11 Some of these firms also provide their games as apps on certain mobile devices;12 these are distributed through app stores, such as Google Play and Apple’s App Store.

Consoles are typically sold at a loss; the manufacturers then profit from sales of games and subscription services.13 This can incentivize console producers to acquire developers and publishers and offer exclusive content.14 Technological developments have allowed some PCs and other devices, depending on their hardware capabilities, to compete with game consoles.15 For example, early in 2022, Valve Corp. released a handheld PC—Steam Deck—that resembles the Nintendo Switch console but provides features that are typically available on PCs, such as a web browser, and allows users to download third-party software, including other operating systems.16 Some firms have started offering video game subscription services that provide access to multiple games for a monthly fee, meaning users do not need to purchase each individual game.17 Some firms offer cloud gaming, which allows users to play video games using remote servers in data centers, reducing the hardware requirements needed to play the games and expanding the variety of devices that can be used.18 Cloud gaming, however, requires a high-speed internet connection and is not feasible for potential users who do not have access to sufficiently high broadband speeds.19 Subscription services reportedly provide 4% of total revenue in the North American and European video game markets.20 Some firms backed by venture capitalists and large firms that are primarily known for providing other online services have shown interest in entering the video game industry.21 For example, Netflix started offering games on mobile devices on November 2, 2021, and has acquired video game developers.22 These firms may be able to further expand the selection of distributors available for certain devices and potentially increase competition in the industry.23 

Microsoft and Activision Blizzard in the Video Game Industry Microsoft distributes video games using Microsoft Store, its subscription service Game Pass,24 and its cloud gaming service Xbox Cloud Gaming (Beta);25 publishes games, including the franchises Halo and Minecraft; 26 and owns 23 gaming studios.27 In 2021, Microsoft had the second-highest share in the U.S. market for game consoles at 34.8%, according to a report from MarketLine, an industry research firm; estimates for Sony and Nintendo were 40.7% and 24.5%, respectively.28 In January 2022, Microsoft stated that it had more than 25 million Game Pass subscribers.29 In April 2022, Microsoft reported that more than 10 million people have streamed games over Xbox Cloud Gaming,30 although it is unclear how long or how many times users accessed the service. Estimates from Ampere Analysis reportedly indicate that Game Pass makes up about 60% of the video game subscription market.31 Among video game publishers in the United States, Microsoft had the highest market share at 23.9%, according to IBISWorld.32 Activision Blizzard is a video game publisher and developer primarily known for its franchise games, which include World of Warcraft, Call of Duty, Diablo, and Candy Crush. 33 The company can be separated into three segments—Activision, Blizzard, and King—that each contain their own gaming studios. Among video game publishers in the United States, Activision Blizzard had the second highest market share at 10%, according to IBISWorld.34 Activision also distributes video games for PCs through its digital store—Battle.net.35 

Among video game publishers in the United States, Microsoft and Activision Blizzard are estimated to have the largest market shares.47 IBISWorld reports, however, that competition among publishers and developers is high, even though the success of new entrants, particularly among developers, is fairly low.48 Publishers and developers can face high levels of uncertainty and risk.49 Furthermore, measuring the market share of Microsoft and Activision Blizzard within the United States may not accurately reflect competition in these markets, given that these companies compete at a global level. Some industry analysts list Tencent, which is headquartered in China, as the largest video game publisher worldwide based on revenue;50 Microsoft and Activision Blizzard are listed among the top 10, along with Sony, Nintendo, EA, and Take-Two Interactive.51 Microsoft stated that after its acquisition of Activision Blizzard, it would “become the world’s third-largest gaming company by revenue, behind Tencent and Sony.” 52

Do Camera Megapixels Matter in 2024? (For Photography)
 

 Having more megapixels on your digital camera or smartphone can be useful.
 

 However, do megapixels matter when it comes to overall image quality?
 

 Photographers love to discuss the merits of more camera megapixels in digital photography.
 

 In this guide, I’ll explain why having more megapixels isn’t always necessary… nor a good thing.
 

 You’ll also discover which digital cameras and smartphones have the highest pixel count in 2024.
 

 What Do MegaPixels Mean on a Camera?
 

 The megapixels on a camera refer to the pixel count present in the sensor. For example, if you have a 24 MP camera, it means that the final image will have 24 million pixels.
 

 The total pixel count is what’s known as the camera resolution. You can calculate the resolution by multiplying the number of pixels on the horizontal side of the sensor by the ones on the vertical side.
 

 If the camera sensor has a 2:3 aspect ratio – this means that the 24 megapixels are distributed as 6000 on one side and 4000 in the other.
 How many megapixels can the human eye see?
 

 Well, the human eye doesn’t actually have pixels. So, comparing the human eye to a camera’s sensor is not like comparing the resolution of two cameras. What we know is an estimate calculated by photographer and scientist Dr. Roger N. Clark.
 

 Using very complex math, he determined that the human eye ‘resolution’ is 576 megapixels. You can learn more about how he reached this result on his website – Clarkvision.
 

 However, according to an article published by Lasik – 576 MP is the resolution reached when moving. Instead, on a single glance, the human eye has a 5 to 15 MP ‘resolution’.
 

 Are There Any Drawbacks to Having Too Many Megapixels?
 

 The first drawback of having more megapixels is that you’ll have bigger files. This means that you’ll fill the memory card faster and you’ll need more storage space either on your hard drive or a cloud service to back them up.
 

 This is a fair compromise when you actually need high-resolution images. However, if you have large files because they have more megapixels than you need, then it’s not worth it.
 

 Another potential drawback is the slower processing time. This may affect you when shooting, transferring, and editing the files.
 

 Large files in-camera take longer to be saved in the memory card. If you shoot in burst mode – for example, it could diminish the fps.
 

 It could also mean slowing the processing to transfer, cull, and edit your photos – this also depends on how powerful is your computer.
 

 Also, when the camera sensors aren’t big enough for the amount of pixels, you’ll have a bigger image resolution but not higher image quality. You’ll probably have issues like noise and reduced dynamic range.
 When Are More Megapixels An Advantage?

 More megapixels are better when you’re talking about print size. The more megapixels you have, the bigger you can print your image.
 

 Another situation in which more megapixels are beneficial is when you need to crop your image.
 

 This is because even if you lose megapixels by cutting out part of your photo – the file still has enough resolution to print or zoom on your screen.
 

  How to Choose Photo Resolution & Size for Printing Or Online Use
 

 How Many Megapixels Do Photographers Actually Need?
 

 If you’re wondering how many megapixels you need to print high-resolution images, you need to multiply the print size by 300 – which is the standard dpi for photographic printing.
 

 So, if you need to print an 8″ x 10″ photo, it needs to have 2,400 x 3,000 pixels. To print a 16″ x 24″ you need a file with 4,800 x 7,200 pixels and so on.
 How many megapixels do professional photographers use?
 

 Unfortunately, there isn’t a straight answer to this. The megapixels required by a professional photographer depend on the type of photos they do and how the images are going to be used.
 

 To give an approximate number, most professional DSLR and mirrorless cameras have a resolution between 24 and 36 MP. However, some professionals use medium-format digital cameras that range from 50 to 100 MP.
 How many megapixels do you need for wedding photography?
 

 Most professional wedding photographers can make do with a resolution ranging from 20 to 24 MP. However, depending on the prints and wedding albums you plan to deliver (and also how much you usually crop your photos), having higher-resolution cameras can be an advantage.
 Does the megapixel count change if you shoot in RAW or JPG?
 

 The number of megapixels on the RAW and JPG files may be different depending on the camera settings.
 

 Most cameras allow you to choose the size of the RAW and JPG files they save. For example, I can set a Canon 90D to shoot in C-RAW and save a raw file of 32MP (6960 x 4640) and a small file JPG file of 3.8MP (2400 x 1600).
 

 Each camera will have different sizes available for each file type – you’ll need to check yours on the user’s manual or by doing a quick Google search.
 

 What About Megapixels and Smartphone Photography?
 

  
 

 You’ve probably seen smartphones that advertise enough megapixels to beat any DSLR or mirrorless cameras on the market.
 

 This may lead you to wonder why isn’t professional photographers don’t use smartphones to take photos for their jobs.
 

 Well, camera lenses, the ability to sync with flashes, and many other features make this impossible.
 

 However, it’s not just that, it’s also because of how smartphones get to that pixel count and what that means in resolution and quality.
 

 Due to their size, it’s impossible for them to actually fit such a larger sensor inside the device. So, smartphone manufacturers incorporate advanced technologies like pixel binning or computational photography to improve image quality without increasing the number of individual pixels.

USER REQUEST:
I'm scratching my head at the idea of megapixels lately, I don't sense any improvements in my upgraded phone's images, even though it has higher megapixels. Please explain this to me in less than 200 words.","Smartphones often advertise high megapixel counts, but this doesn't always translate to better image quality due to physical limitations [1]. Due to their size, it's impossible for smartphones to fit large sensors inside the device [1]. When camera sensors aren’t big enough for the amount of pixels, you might achieve a bigger image resolution but not necessarily higher image quality, potentially leading to issues like noise and reduced dynamic range [1].

Instead, smartphone manufacturers incorporate advanced technologies like pixel binning or computational photography to improve image quality [1]. Therefore, while your phone may have more megapixels, other factors like sensor size and how these pixels are processed significantly influence the final image quality, which can explain the lack of perceived improvement [1].","It's completely understandable why you're scratching your head! While your new phone might boast more megapixels, it doesn't always translate directly to a noticeable jump in image quality, and here's why:

Smartphone cameras have physical limitations, especially with sensor size. To achieve those high megapixel counts in a tiny phone body, manufacturers often use techniques like **pixel binning** or **computational photography**. This means multiple small pixels are combined to act as one larger, more light-sensitive pixel, or software stitches together information.

So, you get a higher *number* of pixels, but not necessarily larger, higher-quality individual pixels or a bigger sensor to capture more light and detail naturally. Other factors like the quality of the lens, image processing algorithms, and overall sensor technology often play a much bigger role in the final look of your photos than just the sheer megapixel count alone. For everyday viewing, those extra megapixels might not make a significant difference."

If you have sleep apnea, not enough air can flow into your lungs
through your mouth and nose during sleep, even though breathing
efforts continue. When this happens, the amount of oxygen in your
blood decreases. Your brain responds by awakening you enough to
tighten the upper airway muscles and open your windpipe. Normal
breaths then start again, often with a loud snort or choking sound.
Although people who have sleep apnea typically snore loudly and
frequently, not everyone who snores has sleep apnea. 
Because people who have sleep apnea frequently go from deeper
sleep to lighter sleep during the night, they rarely spend enough time
in deep, restorative stages of sleep. They are therefore often excessively sleepy during the day. Such sleepiness is thought to lead to
mood and behavior problems, including depression, and it more
than triples the risk of being in a traffic or work-related accident.
The many brief drops in blood-oxygen levels that occur during the
night can result in morning headaches and trouble concentrating,
thinking clearly, learning, and remembering. Additionally, the
intermittent oxygen drops and reduced sleep quality together trigger
the release of stress hormones. These hormones raise your blood
pressure and heart rate and boost the risk of heart attack, stroke,
irregular heartbeats, and congestive heart failure. In addition,
untreated sleep apnea can lead to changes in energy metabolism (the
way your body changes food and oxygen into energy) that increase
the risk for developing obesity and diabetes.
Anyone can have sleep apnea. It is estimated that at least 12–18
million American adults have sleep apnea, making it as common as
asthma. More than one-half of the people who have sleep apnea are
overweight. Sleep apnea is more common in men. More than 1 in
25 middle-aged men and 1 in 50 middle-aged women have sleep
apnea along with extreme daytime sleepiness. About 3 percent of
children and 10 percent or more of people over age 65 have sleep
apnea. This condition occurs more frequently in African Americans,
Asians, Native Americans, and Hispanics than in Caucasians.
More than one-half of all people who have sleep apnea are not
diagnosed. People who have sleep apnea generally are not aware
that their breathing stops in the night. They just notice that they
don’t feel well rested when they wake up and are sleepy throughout
the day. Their bed partners are likely to notice, however, that they
snore loudly and frequently and that they
often stop breathing briefly while
sleeping. Doctors suspect sleep apnea
if these symptoms are present, but
the diagnosis must be confirmed
with overnight sleep monitoring.
This
monitoring will reveal pauses in
breathing, frequent sleep
arousals (changes from
sleep to wakefulness), and
intermittent drops in
levels of oxygen in
the blood.
Like adults who have sleep apnea, children who have this disorder
usually snore loudly, snort or gasp, and have brief pauses in breath
ing while sleeping. Small children often have enlarged tonsils and
adenoids that increase their risk for sleep apnea. But doctors may
not suspect sleep apnea in children because, instead of showing the
typical signs of sleepiness during the day, these children often
become agitated and may be considered hyperactive. The effects of
sleep apnea in children may include poor school performance and
difficult, aggressive behavior.
A number of factors can make a person susceptible to sleep apnea.
These factors include:
Throat muscles and tongue that relax more than normal while
asleep
Enlarged tonsils and adenoids
Being overweight—the excess fat tissue around your neck
makes it harder to keep the throat area open
Head and neck shape that creates a somewhat smaller airway
size in the mouth and throat area
Congestion, due to allergies, that also can narrow the airway
Family history of sleep apnea
If your doctor suspects that you have sleep apnea, you may be
referred to a sleep specialist. Some of the ways to help diagnose
sleep apnea include:
A medical history that includes asking you and your family
questions about how you sleep and how you function during
the day.
Checking your mouth, nose, and throat for extra or large
tissues—for example, checking the tonsils, uvula (the tissue
that hangs from the middle of the back of the mouth), and soft
palate (the roof of your mouth in the back of your throat).
An overnight recording of what happens with your breathing
during sleep (polysomnogram, or PSG).
A multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), usually done in a sleep
center, to see how quickly you fall asleep at times when you
would normally be awake. (Falling asleep in only a few
minutes usually means that you are very sleepy during the day.
Being very sleepy during the day can be a sign of sleep apnea.
Once all the tests are completed, the sleep specialist will review the
results and work with you and your family to develop a treatment
plan. Changes in daily activities or habits may help reduce your
symptoms:
Sleep on your side instead of on your back. Sleeping on your
side will help reduce the amount of upper airway collapse
during sleep.
Avoid alcohol, smoking, sleeping pills, herbal supplements,
and any other medications that make you sleepy. They make
it harder for your airways to stay open while you sleep, and
sedatives can make the breathing pauses longer and more
severe. Tobacco smoke irritates the airways and can help
trigger the intermittent collapse of the upper airway.
Lose weight if you are overweight. Even a little weight loss
can sometimes improve symptoms.
These changes may be all that are needed to treat mild sleep apnea.
However, if you have moderate or severe sleep apnea, you will need
additional, more direct treatment approaches.
Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the most effective
treatment for sleep apnea in adults. A CPAP machine uses mild air
pressure to keep your airways open while you sleep. The machine
delivers air to your airways through a specially designed nasal mask.
The mask does not breathe for you; the flow of air creates increased
pressure to keep the airways in your nose and mouth more open
while you sleep. The air pressure is adjusted so that it is just enough
to stop your airways from briefly becoming too small during sleep.
The pressure is constant and continuous. Sleep apnea will return if
CPAP is stopped or if it is used incorrectly.
People who have severe sleep apnea symptoms generally feel much
better once they begin treatment with CPAP. CPAP treatment can
cause side effects in some people. Possible side effects include dry or
stuffy nose, irritation of the skin on the face, bloating of the stom
ach, sore eyes, or headaches. If you have trouble with CPAP side
effects, work with your sleep specialist and support staff. Together,
you can do things to reduce or eliminate these problems.
Currently, no medications cure sleep apnea. However, some
prescription medications may help relieve the excessive sleepiness
that sometimes persists even with CPAP treatment of sleep apnea.
Another treatment approach that may help some people is the use of
a mouthpiece (oral or dental appliance). If you have mild sleep
apnea or do not have sleep apnea but snore very loudly, your doctor
or dentist also may recommend this. A custom-fitted plastic mouth
piece will be made by a dentist or an orthodontist (a specialist in
correcting teeth or jaw problems). The mouthpiece will adjust your
lower jaw and tongue to help keep the airway in your throat more
open while you are sleeping. Air can then flow more easily into your
lungs because there is less resistance to breathing. Following up
with the dentist or orthodontist is important to correct any side
effects and to be sure that your mouthpiece continues to fit properly.
It is also important to have a followup sleep study to see whether
your sleep apnea has improved.
Some people who have sleep apnea may benefit from surgery; this
depends on the findings of the evaluation by the sleep specialist.
Removing tonsils and adenoids that are blocking the airway is done
frequently, especially in children. Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty
(UPPP) is a surgery for adults that removes the tonsils, uvula, and
part of the soft palate. Tracheostomy is a surgery used rarely and
only in severe sleep apnea when no other treatments have been
successful. A small hole is made in the windpipe, and a tube is
inserted. Air will flow through the tube and into the lungs, bypass
ing the obstruction in the upper airway.

Additionally, excessive sleepiness may sometimes persist even with CPAP treatment [However, some prescription medications may help relieve the excessive sleepiness that sometimes persists even with CPAP treatment of sleep apnea.].","CPAP (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure) therapy is a widely used and highly effective treatment for sleep apnea, but like any medical intervention, it comes with its own set of advantages and potential drawbacks.

Here's a breakdown of the pros and cons:

### Pros of Using a CPAP Machine:

*   **Highly Effective Treatment:** The document states that CPAP is the ""most effective treatment for sleep apnea in adults."" It works by delivering mild air pressure through a mask to keep your airways open while you sleep, preventing the brief stops in breathing that characterize sleep apnea.
*   **Significant Symptom Improvement:** People with severe sleep apnea symptoms often report feeling ""much better"" once they start CPAP treatment. This is because it helps them achieve deeper, more restorative sleep.
*   **Addresses the Root Cause:** Instead of just managing symptoms, CPAP directly tackles the physical obstruction or collapse of the airway, allowing for continuous airflow and maintaining oxygen levels.
*   **Prevents Serious Health Complications:** By effectively treating sleep apnea, CPAP can help reduce the risk of numerous health problems associated with the condition, such as high blood pressure, heart attack, stroke, irregular heartbeats, congestive heart failure, obesity, and diabetes. It also mitigates issues like daytime sleepiness, mood problems, and difficulty concentrating.

### Cons of Using a CPAP Machine:

*   **Requires Consistent Use:** For CPAP to be effective, it must be used consistently and correctly every time you sleep. If treatment is stopped or used improperly, the sleep apnea symptoms will return.
*   **Potential Side Effects:** While highly effective, some people experience side effects, which can include:
    *   Dry or stuffy nose
    *   Irritation of the skin on the face (often from the mask)
    *   Bloating of the stomach
    *   Sore eyes
    *   Headaches
*   **Adjusting to the Equipment:** Getting used to sleeping with a mask and the machine can take time for some individuals. The document suggests working with a sleep specialist and support staff to address any side effects or discomfort and find ways to reduce or eliminate these problems.
*   **No Cure:** It's important to remember that CPAP manages sleep apnea; it doesn't cure it. This means it's generally a long-term treatment.

In summary, CPAP offers significant benefits in treating sleep apnea and improving overall health and quality of life by ensuring consistent airflow during sleep. However, it does require commitment to consistent use and working through potential side effects with your healthcare team to ensure comfort and effectiveness."

**Innovations in Hepatitis C Screening and Treatment**
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major public health threat worldwide, with approximately 71 million people living with chronic infection.( 1 , 2 ) The approval of direct‐acting antivirals (DAAs) starting in 2014 revolutionized treatment and allows nearly all patients to be cured.( 3 ) The number of individuals initiating HCV treatment has increased from approximately 500,000 in 2014 to over 2 million in 2017.( 4 ) In 2016, the World Health Organization called for HCV to be eliminated as a global public health threat by 2030, setting a goal of reducing new infections by 90%, treating 80% of chronic infections, and reducing mortality by 65%.( 5 )

However, few countries are on track to reaching these HCV elimination targets. Globally, only 19% of chronically infected individuals report being aware of their infection, and 15.3% had been treated with DAAs by the end of 2017.( 1 ) In the United States, HCV remains the most common bloodborne infection, affecting 2 million people,( 2 ) and in 2016, more than half of individuals reported being unaware of their infection.( 6 ) HCV‐related mortality continues to rise, surpassing the combined total of 60 other nationally notifiable infectious conditions, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).( 2 , 7 , 8 , 9 ) The United States Preventive Services Task Force, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD), the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently updated their guidelines to recommend universal HCV testing among adults.( 10 , 11 )

The 2020 standard of HCV care has evolved toward universal screening and treatment.( 12 ) However, there is currently a considerable drop‐off between each step of the HCV “cascade to cure,” from screening, diagnosis, evaluation, treatment, cure, prevention of reinfection, and care for cirrhosis (Fig. 1).( 13 ) Low rates of diagnosis result in even lower rates of treatment and ultimately cure. Innovation can help address major barriers in these steps to move us toward HCV elimination (Fig. 2). In this review, we focus on a combination of barriers at the system, provider, and patient level, with an emphasis on how system‐level and provider‐level enhancements are critical in overcoming what have traditionally been deemed patient‐level barriers. Since the interferon era, there has been focus on persons living with HCV in silos, some with blame and consequently stigma for their behaviors, when it is system‐level and provider‐level policies and practices that have presented as barriers that need to be addressed. Implementing interventions tailored toward “hardly reached” populations, the micro‐elimination approach, is a key strategy for achieving HCV elimination.( 14 , 15 ) They complement population‐level macro‐elimination programs. Herein, we highlight interventions that address the HCV cascade to cure in hardly reached populations, including (1) persons who inject drugs (PWIDs) and persons who are marginally housed; (2) correctional populations; and (3) women who are pregnant (Table 1). We hope readers can conceptualize members of these groups as being underserved by traditional engagement efforts, rather than as people with inherent qualities that make them challenging to engage and treat. We also discuss broader efforts to use innovation to eliminate HCV across health systems and countries. The interventions in this review specifically improve screening, case finding, linkage to care (broadly defined as strategies that lead to access to HCV care), treatment delivery and/or adherence, and cure.

 What is the Best Purse to Travel With | How to Pick
 If there is one accessory I love, it is a good purse. I love how they are practical, but can make an entire outfit look put together. I have a lot of purses...too many probably! But I get a lot out of each one of them.
 

 There are so many different kinds of purses and so many different ways to use them. I will be talking a lot about other purses in later posts, but today I want to talk about the best purses to take when you are traveling. I personally think that a good cross-body bag is the best kind of bag to have when traveling. They are so versatile and they allow you to have your hands free while still storing your necessities in style.
 

 What is the Best Purse to Travel With | My Favorites
 In Turkey, I was touting a Coach Mini Willis cross body. I have this bag in three different colors and it's a great bag for traveling! While it is on the smaller side, it is big enough to hold a small wallet, phone, chapstick and sunglasses. It is perfect for when you are touring a city but don't want to take a lot with you. It's also really nice because you can easily move it to hang in front of you so you can ward off pickpockets!
 

 For my birthday last year, my mom gave me the Michael Kors Large Jet Set Traveler in gray. That is a pretty awesome bag. It fits perfectly into my Michael Kors computer bag so I can throw it in there right before I get on a plane and I can pull it back out when I get off. I love that the color goes with just about anything and it fits a LOT of stuff! The last trip I took it on, I got a wallet, glasses, sunglasses, phone, planner, notebook and some pens in there. I have been really happy with how well it has worn too. The leather isn't my favorite but it has a coating on it that keeps stains and water off.
 

 Here you can glimpse my newest cross-body obsession from kate spade new york. I took this on my recent trip to Jordan and I loved it! It is much bigger than the Coach bag, and has more room in it than the Michael Kors. It also has a zipper pocket that folds down across the top. The leather on this bag is so soft and I love how pink it is. I found this beauty for a steal at a kate spade outlet sale. The entire store was 50% off with an additional 20% bags. It was a great buy! I will keep an eye out for their next outlet sale and make sure I update you all on it!

Grey hydrogen and blue hydrogen The grey hydrogen considered in this study is produced by SMR technology, and the production starts with hydrogen purging with natural gas feedstock to break long hydrocarbon chains. This step is followed by sulphur removal by chemical absorption on a ZnO bed because even a small amount of sulphur present in natural gas poisons the catalyst. Then, methane is fed to the steam reformer together with steam. The subsequent reaction is a strongly endothermic reaction and produces a mixture containing hydrogen and carbon monoxide. The required steam is assumed to be produced from natural gas. Next, the produced syngas and steam go to a water gas shift reactor to produce more hydrogen and some carbon dioxide from the carbon monoxide. Subsequently, the pressure swing adsorbent (PSA) process is used to separate hydrogen and CO2 and the hydrogen is stored with a compression to 60 bar.19 Unrecovered hydrogen, methane, CO and other compounds go to the furnace to produce heat for the reformer.20 A study by Alhamdani et al. (2017) showed that the fugitive emission from the SMR process is equal to 0.004 kg CO2 eq. per kg H2 and does not have a major impact.21 In view of the low level of fugitive emissions, their effects are neglected in this study. An overview of a typical SMR process is given in Fig. 3. The production process for blue hydrogen is the same as that for grey hydrogen, except that carbon dioxide is captured from the plant, stored and sequestered as shown in Fig. 3.
 

 Fig. 3 Grey hydrogen (SMR) and blue hydrogen (SMR-CCS) production (modified from Petrescu et al., 2014).19
 2.3.2. Turquoise hydrogen TDM consumes less natural gas than SMR for hydrogen production and has lower total environmental impact.22 This superior environmental performance is because the TDM process does not release carbon dioxide to air. Moreover, since carbon dioxide is in a solid form, carbon gas cannot escape from the process, and a large amount of carbon dioxide can be captured with little impact on the environment. Typically, TDM is a form of pyrolysis of methane at a high temperature of 1500 K. There are two alternate routes in this process: one involving the use of a catalyst, which requires a lower temperature of around 1000 K, and the other without a catalyst, which requires a higher temperature of 1500 K.23 One of the advantages of pyrolysis of methane is that the only reaction products are hydrogen and solid carbon, thereby preventing the formation of CO2 during the reaction.24 Consequently, TDM is considered a promising alternative method for hydrogen production and can be seen in Fig. 4. The produced solid carbon can be utilised in many applications, such as chemical and industrial use.5 The benefit of using TDM is that it does not depend on CCS development and the infrastructure since the output carbon is in the solid form.25

 2.3.3. Green hydrogen Electrolysis of water to split water into oxygen and hydrogen using renewable energy as an electricity source is currently considered the most promising method for carbon-free hydrogen production. Electrolyzers range in size from small apparatus-sized devices suitable for small-scale decentralized production of hydrogen to large centralized production facilities that could be directly connected to renewable or other zero-emission forms of electricity generation. A number of different electrolyzer types exist that operate on different principles: polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolyzers, alkaline electrolyzers and solid electrolyzers.26 An overview of the general process of water electrolysis for hydrogen production is given in Fig. 5. By-product oxygen from water hydrolysis can be used in combustion processes in the form of oxygen-enriched air to overcome mass transfer limitations and increase the flame speed and temperature.

Understanding them is key to grasping their role in our future energy landscape, especially concerning climate change. The ""color"" designations help us quickly understand how ""clean"" the production process is, referring mainly to the carbon emissions associated with their creation.

Let's break down the main types discussed in your document:

### 1. Grey Hydrogen

*   **How it's Produced:** Grey hydrogen is currently the most common form of hydrogen produced globally. It's made primarily through a process called **Steam Methane Reforming (SMR)**. This involves:
    1.  **Feedstock Preparation:** Natural gas is used as the raw material. It undergoes a ""purging"" step to break down long hydrocarbon chains and then has sulfur removed, as sulfur can poison catalysts.
    2.  **Steam Reforming:** Methane from the natural gas is mixed with steam and heated to high temperatures. This strongly endothermic (heat-absorbing) reaction produces a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide (known as syngas). The steam itself is also assumed to be produced from natural gas.
    3.  **Water Gas Shift:** The syngas then goes to another reactor where the carbon monoxide reacts with more steam to produce additional hydrogen and carbon dioxide.
    4.  **Separation and Storage:** Finally, a process called Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) separates the hydrogen from the carbon dioxide and other compounds. The hydrogen is then compressed and stored. Any unrecovered gases are typically sent to a furnace to provide heat for the reformer.
*   **Relevance to Climate Change:** This is where grey hydrogen becomes problematic. The SMR process releases **significant amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2)** directly into the atmosphere. While some fugitive emissions (leaks) are mentioned as minor in the study, the primary issue is the direct CO2 generated from the chemical reactions and the energy used. Therefore, grey hydrogen *contributes* to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions.

### 2. Blue Hydrogen

*   **How it's Produced:** Blue hydrogen is essentially grey hydrogen with an upgrade! The production process is **identical to grey hydrogen (SMR)**, using natural gas as a feedstock. The key difference is that the **carbon dioxide produced during the SMR process is captured and then stored or sequestered** (Carbon Capture and Storage - CCS). This means the CO2 is prevented from being released into the atmosphere.
*   **Relevance to Climate Change:** Blue hydrogen offers a significant improvement over grey hydrogen in terms of climate impact. By capturing and storing the CO2, it **drastically reduces the greenhouse gas emissions** associated with hydrogen production. It's considered a ""low-carbon"" hydrogen option and acts as a transitional step towards fully carbon-free hydrogen production, especially in regions with abundant natural gas resources and suitable geological storage sites for CO2.

### 3. Turquoise Hydrogen

*   **How it's Produced:** Turquoise hydrogen is produced through a process called **Thermal Decomposition of Methane (TDM)**, also known as methane pyrolysis. Unlike SMR, TDM does not involve steam reforming.
    1.  **Methane Pyrolysis:** Methane is heated to very high temperatures (around 1500 K, or 1000 K if a catalyst is used).
    2.  **Products:** The methane breaks down directly into two main products: **hydrogen and solid carbon**.
*   **Relevance to Climate Change:** This is a very promising ""low-carbon"" or potentially ""zero-carbon"" approach.
    *   **No CO2 Emissions:** Crucially, the TDM process **does not release carbon dioxide into the air**. The carbon from the methane is produced in a solid form.
    *   **Solid Carbon Utilization:** The solid carbon byproduct can be a valuable resource for various industrial and chemical applications, rather than being a waste product.
    *   **No CCS Infrastructure Needed:** An added benefit is that it doesn't rely on complex carbon capture and storage infrastructure because the carbon is already in a solid state and can't easily escape as a gas. This gives it a lower total environmental impact compared to SMR-based methods.

### 4. Green Hydrogen

*   **How it's Produced:** Green hydrogen is widely considered the ultimate goal for carbon-free hydrogen production. It's produced through **electrolysis of water**:
    1.  **Electrolysis:** Water (H2O) is split into its constituent elements: hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2).
    2.  **Renewable Energy Source:** The critical distinction for ""green"" hydrogen is that the electricity used to power this electrolysis process comes **exclusively from renewable energy sources**, such as solar, wind, or hydropower.
    3.  **Electrolyzer Types:** Various types of electrolyzers exist, including Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (PEM), alkaline, and solid electrolyzers, each with slightly different operating principles.
*   **Relevance to Climate Change:** Green hydrogen is the **gold standard for carbon-free hydrogen**.
    *   **Zero Emissions:** Because it uses renewable energy and its only by-product is oxygen (from the water), it generates **no greenhouse gas emissions** during its production.
    *   **Clean Energy Transition:** It is central to decarbonizing hard-to-abate sectors like heavy industry, long-haul transport, and electricity generation, playing a vital role in achieving global climate goals and transitioning away from fossil fuels.

In summary, as we move from grey to blue, turquoise, and finally to green hydrogen, the associated greenhouse gas emissions decrease, making green hydrogen the most environmentally friendly option as we strive for a sustainable future."

**Plant‐Based Diets Are Associated With a Lower Risk of Incident Cardiovascular Disease, Cardiovascular Disease Mortality, and All‐Cause Mortality in a General Population of Middle‐Aged Adults**
Abstract

Background
Previous studies have documented the cardiometabolic health benefits of plant‐based diets; however, these studies were conducted in selected study populations that had narrow generalizability.

Methods and Results
We used data from a community‐based cohort of middle‐aged adults (n=12 168) in the ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) study who were followed up from 1987 through 2016. Participants’ diet was classified using 4 diet indexes. In the overall plant‐based diet index and provegetarian diet index, higher intakes of all or selected plant foods received higher scores; in the healthy plant‐based diet index, higher intakes of only the healthy plant foods received higher scores; in the less healthy plant‐based diet index, higher intakes of only the less healthy plant foods received higher scores. In all indexes, higher intakes of animal foods received lower scores. Results from Cox proportional hazards models showed that participants in the highest versus lowest quintile for adherence to overall plant‐based diet index or provegetarian diet had a 16%, 31% to 32%, and 18% to 25% lower risk of cardiovascular disease, cardiovascular disease mortality, and all‐cause mortality, respectively, after adjusting for important confounders (all P<0.05 for trend). Higher adherence to a healthy plant‐based diet index was associated with a 19% and 11% lower risk of cardiovascular disease mortality and all‐cause mortality, respectively, but not incident cardiovascular disease (P<0.05 for trend). No associations were observed between the less healthy plant‐based diet index and the outcomes.

Conclusions
Diets higher in plant foods and lower in animal foods were associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in a general population.


Clinical Perspective

What Is New?
    • Plant‐based diets, diets that emphasize higher intakes of plant foods and lower intakes of animal foods, are associated with a lower risk of incident cardiovascular disease, cardiovascular disease mortality, and all‐cause mortality in a general US adult population.
    • Healthful plant‐based diets, diets higher in nutrient‐dense plant foods and lower in refined carbohydrates and animal foods, are associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease mortality and all‐cause mortality, but not incident cardiovascular disease.

What Are the Clinical Implications?
    • Our results suggest that dietary patterns that are relatively higher in plant foods and relatively lower in animal foods may confer benefits for cardiovascular health.
    • Future research examining whether the quality of plant foods (healthful versus less healthful) within the framework of an overall plant‐based diet is associated with cardiovascular disease and all‐cause mortality is warranted.

Introduction
Plant‐based diets are dietary patterns that emphasize higher intakes of plant foods and are low in animal foods. Vegetarian diets, a type of plant‐based diet, with a focus on restriction of different types of animal foods (meat, poultry, or fish), have been associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular risk factors, such as obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and ischemic heart disease.1, 2, 3 However, prospective cohort studies have shown mixed results on the associations with cardiovascular disease mortality and all‐cause mortality.4, 5, 6 These previous studies were conducted in selected study populations that were mostly composed of Seventh‐Day Adventists, vegetarians, or health‐conscious individuals; thus, they had relatively narrow generalizability.4, 5, 7, 8, 9
Although prior studies have characterized participants’ diets using a relatively simple classification method based on frequency of animal food consumption,4, 5, 6 there have since been more comprehensive attempts to assess an individual's diet using plant‐based diet indexes.10, 11, 12, 13 These indexes give higher scores for higher consumption of plant foods and lower consumption of animal foods, allowing researchers to examine whether the degree of adherence to an overall plant‐based diet is associated with health outcomes. Studies that used such indexes (ie, an overall plant‐based diet index [PDI] or a provegetarian diet index) found that greater adherence to these diets was associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, and all‐cause mortality.10, 11, 12 In addition, some plant‐based indexes separately scored healthful (whole grains, vegetables, and plant proteins) and unhealthful (refined carbohydrates and sugar) plant sources of food. Healthful plant‐based diets, which scored higher intakes of only healthful plant foods higher, were more strongly inversely associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus and coronary heart disease than the overall plant‐based diets.11, 12 In contrast, greater adherence to less healthful (unhealthful) plant‐based diets, which scored higher intakes of only less healthful plant foods higher, were associated with a higher risk of these conditions.11, 12
Given the limited evidence on plant‐based diets in the general population and recent developments in plant‐based diet scores, the objectives of the present study were as follows: (1) to evaluate whether overall plant‐based diets are associated with a lower risk of incident cardiovascular disease, cardiovascular disease mortality, and all‐cause mortality in a general US population; and (2) to assess if the association differed by adherence to healthful and less healthful plant‐based diets using 4 a priori defined plant‐based diet scores (overall plant‐based diet, healthy plant‐based diet, less healthy plant‐based diet, and provegetarian diet indexes).

Study Design
We used data from a community‐based cohort of middle‐aged men and women (45–64 years of age at baseline, n=15 792) in the ARIC study. From 1987 to 1989, participants from 4 US communities (Washington County, Maryland; Forsyth County, North Carolina; Minneapolis, MN; and Jackson, MS) were enrolled in the study. Follow‐up visits occurred in 1990 to 1992 (visit 2), 1993 to 1995 (visit 3), 1996 to 1998 (visit 4), 2011 to 2013 (visit 5), and 2016 to 2017 (visit 6).14 The Institutional Review Board at each study site approved the study protocol, and participants provided informed consent.

Dietary Assessment
At baseline and visit 3, participants’ usual intake of foods and beverages was assessed by trained interviewers using a modified version of the 66‐item semiquantitative Willett food frequency questionnaire. Participants indicated the frequency with which they consumed foods and beverages of a defined serving size in the previous year. Visual guides, such as glasses and measuring cups, were provided for participants to estimate portion size. The reliability of the food frequency questionnaire was assessed in a random sample of ARIC study participants (n=419) from all 4 study sites at visit 2.15 Nutrient and total energy intakes were derived through multiplying consumption of food by nutrient content of each item in the food frequency questionnaire.

Plant‐Based Diet Scores
The ARIC study did not assess whether participants were following a plant‐based diet. We used established plant‐based diet scores (PDI, healthy plant‐based diet index [hPDI], less healthy [unhealthy] plant‐based diet index [uPDI], and provegetarian diet index) to assess participants’ degree of adherence to plant‐based diets on the basis of their reported dietary intake on the food frequency questionnaire. We used these 4 plant‐based diet indexes to provide comprehensive and nuanced characterization of dietary intakes because the indexes differed from each other in scoring of food groups within the indexes. For instance, the PDI was more comprehensive than the provegetarian index in that the PDI assessed dietary intakes of plant foods high in refined carbohydrates (fruit juices, sugar‐sweetened beverages, sweets, and desserts). Consistent with some ethically motivated dietary patterns that are focused on the exclusion of animal sources of food and have less of an emphasis on the quality of plant foods, the provegetarian diet index provides a more simplistic score of the diet in that these refined carbohydrate food groups were not assessed. Further details on differences and construction of the scores have been published previously and are available in Data S1.10, 11, 12, 13, 16
The PDI, hPDI, and uPDI had a possible range from 17 to 85, and the provegetarian diet index had a possible range from 11 to 55. All scores were divided into quintiles for analyses.

Outcome Assessment
Incident cardiovascular disease events and deaths (cardiovascular and all cause) were ascertained through annual telephone calls with participants or proxies, active surveillance of local hospital discharge records and state death records, and linkage to the National Death Index from baseline to December 31, 2016. Incident cardiovascular disease was defined as a composite outcome of coronary heart disease, stroke, and heart failure. Incident coronary heart disease was defined as hospitalized myocardial infarction or fatal coronary heart disease.17 Incident stroke was defined as definite or probable stroke, which was adjudicated.18 Incident heart failure was defined as hospitalization or death, with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD‐9), code 428 or International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD‐10), code I50.19 All‐cause mortality was defined as deaths attributable to any cause, and cardiovascular disease mortality was defined as deaths with ICD‐9 codes 390 to 459 or ICD‐10 codes I00 to I99.

Covariate Assessment
At baseline, participants’ sociodemographic information (age, sex, race/ethnicity, and education), health behaviors (cigarette smoking, frequency and duration of physical activity, alcohol intake, and margarine intake), medication use (lipid‐lowering medication use, antihypertensive medication use, or diabetes mellitus medication use), and health conditions (diagnosis of diseases) were collected by self‐reports.
Trained staff measured participants’ weight and height, which was used to calculate body mass index (BMI; kg/m2). Those whose BMI was ≤25 kg/m2 were classified as normal weight, those whose BMI was from 25 to <30 kg/m2 were classified as overweight, and those whose BMI was ≥30 kg/m2 were classified as obese. An enzymatic method was used to measure total cholesterol concentration.20 A certified technician measured participants’ blood pressure 3 times, and the second and third measurements were averaged. The modified hexokinase/glucose‐6‐phosphate dehydrogenase method was used to measure blood glucose concentrations. Baseline kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate) was estimated from serum creatinine measurement using the 2009 Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation.21 We defined hypertension as systolic blood pressure of ≥140 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure of ≥90 mm Hg, or antihypertensive medication use in the past 2 weeks. We defined diabetes mellitus as fasting glucose concentration of ≥126 mg/dL, nonfasting blood glucose concentration of ≥200 mg/dL, self‐reported physician's diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, or diabetes mellitus medication use in the past 2 weeks.

Cryptocurrency Mining 
There are three primary approaches to gaining ownership of Bitcoin: purchase Bitcoin directly by exchanging conventional money and a paying an exchange fee; earn Bitcoin in return for a product or service; or create Bitcoin through mining. 5 Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies each implement their own blockchain: mining is the creation and publication of a new block in a blockchain.6 Early cryptocurrency platforms, like Bitcoin, required the use of mining to validate transactions. In blockchain platforms generally, miners—those seeking to add a block to a blockchain—are incentivized to improve their value in that blockchain through either a monetary, reputational, or stake award, for example. New blocks may be added to a blockchain through a variety of methods. 
For Bitcoin, new blocks are added to the blockchain through proof-of-work (PoW). Under PoW, miners are presented a difficult computational problem, or puzzle. PoW identifies a numeric value (called a nonce), which is used to generate an authenticator (hash value). Hash values are used to ensure the integrity of data, in this case, that a block of data in the blockchain has not been modified. Hashes are determined by submitting the data through an algorithm that will output a string of characters. By inserting the nonce into the algorithm, miners seek to change the hashvalue. The problem Bitcoin miners are trying to solve is the creation of a hash value for a given block which begins with a certain number of zeros. They add data to the block through changing the nonce in order to change the hash value and discover the solution. Identifying these valid nonces and hashes is computationally intensive, and the essence of mining.7 The security properties of hash algorithms are such that a miner tests nonces until a valid hash is found for a block.

USER REQUEST:
Summarise and simplify how a hash works and explain how this is different from a nonce, each in two to five sentences.","A hash works by submitting data through an algorithm, which outputs a string of characters (7). Hash values are used to ensure the integrity of data, specifically to confirm that a block of data in the blockchain has not been modified (7). For Bitcoin miners, the goal is to create a hash value for a given block that begins with a certain number of zeros (7).

A nonce is a numeric value used to generate an authenticator, which is the hash value (7). Miners insert the nonce into an algorithm to change the hash value (7). They add data to the block by changing the nonce until a valid hash is found for that block (7). Therefore, a nonce is an input that miners manipulate to produce a specific hash value.","Hey there! Let's break down hashes and nonces in the world of cryptocurrency mining.

First, **how a hash works**: Think of a hash as a unique digital fingerprint for a block of data. When you put any data through a special algorithm, it spits out a fixed-length string of characters, called a hash value. Its main job is to ensure data integrity, meaning if even a tiny bit of the original data changes, the hash value will completely change, letting everyone know the data has been tampered with. In Bitcoin mining, miners are trying to generate a very specific hash value that starts with a certain number of zeros to validate a block.

Now, **how a nonce is different**: A nonce (which stands for ""number once"") is essentially a random or arbitrary numeric value that miners add to a block of data. It's not a fingerprint itself, but rather a variable that miners can change. By repeatedly inserting different nonces into the hashing algorithm along with the block's data, miners can alter the resulting hash value. Their goal is to find the ""magic"" nonce that, when combined with the block data, produces the desired hash value that meets the network's difficulty target.

So, in essence, a **nonce is an input value that miners experiment with**, while the **hash is the unique output (the ""fingerprint"")** that results from processing the block data, including that nonce, through a cryptographic algorithm. Miners change the nonce *in order to* generate a target hash."

** Heart Disease**

The human heart beats about 2.5 billion times over an average lifetime, pushing millions of gallons of blood throughout the body. This steady blood flow carries oxygen, hormones, and other compounds. It also whisks away the waste products of metabolism. 

Given the heart's never-ending workload, it's a wonder it performs so well for so long. But it can also fail, brought down by poor diet, lack of exercise, smoking, infection, unfavorable  genes, and more. 

Heart disease and cardiovascular disease are two of the most significant heart health issues. They are often used interchangeably, but they are not the same. 

Heart disease refers to diseases of the heart, such as coronary artery disease, heart failure, heart valve abnormalities, and abnormal heart rhythms.

Cardiovascular disease is a catch-all term for all heart and blood vessel diseases. It includes heart disease, but also stroke.


Does a coronary stent make sense for stable angina?

What are the different types of heart disease?
Heart disease refers to diseases that affect the function and condition of the heart. There are several kinds of heart disease, including: 

cardiomyopathy: a heart muscle disease that causes the heart to become abnormally enlarged, thickened, and/or stiffened.
congenital heart disease: heart disease or abnormalities in the heart's structure that are present at birth.
coronary artery disease: accumulation of cholesterol-filled plaques, which clog the arteries that supply blood and oxygen to the heart. 
endocarditis: infection and inflammation of the heart valves and the inner lining of the heart chambers, called the endocardium.
heart attack (myocardial infarction): the sudden stopping of blood flow to part of the heart muscle
heart failure: the inability of the heart to pump as forcefully or efficiently as needed to supply the body with oxygenated blood.
heart rhythm disorders (arrhythmias): heartbeats that are too fast, too slow, or irregular.
heart valve disorders: problems with the valves that control blood flow from one part of the heart to another part of the heart or to the body.
myocarditis: inflammation of the myocardium, the middle layer of the heart wall, that decreases the ability of the heart to pump blood normally.
pericarditis: inflammation of the pericardium, a thin sac surrounding the heart. 
sudden cardiac arrest: the sudden cessation of the heartbeat.

Controlling Your Blood Pressure
An alarming one in three American adults has high blood pressure. Known medically as hypertension, many people don't even know they have it, because high blood pressure has no symptoms or warning signs. But when elevated blood pressure is accompanied by abnormal cholesterol and blood sugar levels, the damage to your arteries, kidneys, and heart accelerates exponentially. Fortunately, high blood pressure is easy to detect and treat. In the Special Health Report, Controlling Your Blood Pressure, find out how to keep blood pressure in a healthy range simply by making lifestyle changes, such as losing weight, increasing activity, and eating more healthfully.

What causes heart disease?
The most common type of heart disease is coronary artery disease (CAD), and the leading cause of CAD is atherosclerosis, the buildup of cholesterol plaque inside the coronary arteries. Too much plaque limits blood flow through the arteries that supply blood to the heart. Restricted blood flow can cause chest pain or pressure (known as angina) and requires immediate medical attention. When plaque ruptures, it can form a blood clot that stops blood flow and triggers a heart attack. The risk factors for atherosclerosis (and thus CAD) include:

High total blood cholesterol level
High level of LDL (bad) cholesterol
High levels of triglycerides
High levels of lipoprotein(a)
High blood pressure (hypertension)
Diabetes
Family history of heart disease
Smoking
Obesity
Physical inactivity
Inflammation

Heart disease symptoms
A variety of symptoms and signs may indicate heart disease. If you experience any of the following for no apparent reason, immediately report them to your doctor.

Fatigue. Fatigue can be caused by many illnesses and medicines. But constant, new fatigue can sometimes signal two kinds of heart disease: heart failure and coronary artery disease. 

Unexplained aches or pains. Blockage of blood to the heart muscle can cause pain or pressure in the chest, shoulders, arms, back, jaw, or abdomen, primarily when pain in these locations occurs with exercise and disappears with rest.

Shortness of breath. Unexplained shortness of breath that occurs with small amounts of activity. 

Swollen legs, feet, or ankles. The kind of swelling that leaves an indentation if you press your finger into it could be a sign of heart failure. 

Heart palpitations. Palpitations refers to a heartbeat that feels irregular or rapid. Most palpitations may be caused by anxiety, caffeine intake, or dehydration. But sometimes they indicate a heart problem.

How can you prevent heart disease?
The best way to prevent heart disease is to adopt heart-healthy habits. These include managing blood pressure and cholesterol levels, eating a plant-based diet, adopting regular exercise, maintaining a proper weight, getting enough sleep, and not smoking.

Blood pressure. High blood pressure makes the heart work harder, which can weaken the heart muscle over time. Blood pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) and is categorized as follows: 

Normal: Less than 120/80 mm Hg
Elevated: 120/less than 80 to 129/less than 80 mm Hg
Stage 1 hypertension: 130/80 to 139/89 mm Hg
Stage 2 hypertension: 140/90 mm Hg and above
Cholesterol. There are two main types: “bad” low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and “good” high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Ideally, most adults should keep their LDL below 100 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) and their HDL above 40 mg/dL. However, your ideal numbers may differ based on your health, risk factors for heart disease, and individual goals, as determined in consultation with your doctor.

Diet. Following a plant-based diet is known to protect against heart disease. The plant diets that have been most studied for heart health are the Mediterranean diet and the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet. Each emphasizes eating foods associated with heart-healthy benefits, such as whole grains, fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts and seeds, fatty fish, and healthy oils like olive oil, and reducing the intake of red meat and processed foods.

Exercise. Guidelines recommend that adults engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week, which breaks down to 30 minutes daily, five days a week. But this is the minimum. Evidence suggests that doing more is better.

Weight. About 30% of American adults are classified as overweight. While it’s natural for people’s weight to increase somewhat with age, even five to 10 pounds over your ideal number is associated with an increased risk of heart disease. Check with your doctor to determine your weight range for your gender, age, and body type. 

Sleep. Experts recommend that adults get at least seven hours of sleep per night. Studies have found that less than this amount is associated with heart disease risk factors like higher stress levels, increased inflammation, high blood pressure, and weight gain. 

Smoking. Smokers have a much higher heart disease risk than never-smokers and two to three times the risk of early death. Certain medications and nicotine replacement therapies can help people quit. Speak with your doctor about these or other options.

Title: Wharfedale Diamonds Shine Even Brighter

Wharfedale's classic Diamond lineage of high-performance, high-value speakers reaches new heights with the Diamond 200 Series

Huntingdon, England -- For more than 30 years, Wharfedale’s famous Diamond speakers have served as the classic entry point to true high-fidelity sound, their exceptional value for money earning dozens of awards around the globe. Now, with the introduction of the all-new Diamond 200 Series, Wharfedale has once again raised the bar for affordable, high-performance loudspeakers.

Replacing the critically acclaimed Diamond 100 Series, Diamond 200 comprises two standmount speakers and three floorstanding models, plus a center speaker for home cinema use. Given that the speakers’ predecessors were so highly rated for their sound quality, Wharfedale's engineers took an evolutionary approach, precisely targeting key areas to improve in order to make an already great loudspeaker range deliver even better value for money.

Enhancements across the range include:

New cabinet construction – a sandwich of particleboard between MDF, which has enabled improvements both aesthetic and sonic.
New lacquered baffle design further enhances aesthetic qualities.
Improved bass motor system with larger magnets makes the speakers easier to drive and boosts transient acoustic power.
Enhanced 'Slot-Loaded Distributed Port' – improved airflow control lowers turbulence and hence reduces low-frequency distortion.
Upgraded crossover networks further improve the integration between the drive units.
The Wharfedale Diamond 200 Series in full

The first Diamond 200 Series model to launch is the Diamond 220. Available now, this pivotal model is the latest evolution of Wharfedale’s classic Diamond standmount speaker – a neatly proportioned design with a 130mm mid/bass driver. It is the direct replacement for the best-selling Diamond 121 from the outgoing Diamond 100 Series, benefitting from all the enhancements described above, yet Wharfedale has managed to shave £30 off the RRP – the Diamond 220 has an RRP of just £199.95 per pair.

The remaining Diamond 200 Series models arrive this month. These include the Diamond 210, an ultra-compact speaker for rear/surround duties or stereo applications where space is at a premium (£149.95 per pair), plus three floorstanders – the Diamond 230 (£499.95 per pair), Diamond 240 (£699.95 per pair), and Diamond 250 (£999.95 per pair).

The Diamond 220C home cinema center speaker (£199.95) completes the range. Anyone wishing to compile a 5.1 or 7.1 surround sound package from the Diamond 200 Series can add an active subwoofer from Wharfedale’s highly rated PowerCube SPC range, selecting an appropriate model to suit their room.

Many of the speakers’ core features are unchanged from the Diamond 100 Series. The bass and midrange cones are fashioned from woven Kevlar and incorporate semi-elliptical ‘break-up’ areas – visible as raised ‘V’ shapes on the cone’s surface – that smooth the response throughout the audible range. The dust cap is blended and treated to provide a smooth transition with the treble unit, which incorporates an advanced ferrite magnet system and a carefully constructed waveguide around the fabric dome for optimal dispersion.

Bass performance is enhanced by a newly refined version of the Slot-Loaded Distributed Port, first introduced in the outgoing Diamond 100 Series. Instead of the usual circular reflex port, all Diamond 200 Series models incorporate a port that exits at the base of the speaker cabinet, loaded by a slot that is created by the plinth. This equalizes the air pressure to mimic that inside the cabinet, allowing smooth transition between the pressure variation in the cabinet and the low-frequency sound developed in the room.

The result is deep, articulate and well-integrated bass, without the ‘chuffing’ that is often associated with regular front- or rear-mounted ports. It also allows the speakers to be placed closer to a rear wall than is appropriate with most competing designs, making them easier to position in an average room. No other speaker range at such affordable price points implements an advanced bass loading system of this kind.

All Wharfedale Diamond 200 Series speakers come in a choice of four finishes – black, white, walnut, and rosewood – adding to their smart aesthetics and excellent value for money.

Designer’s notes: Peter Comeau, Wharfedale’s Director of Acoustic Design

Peter Comeau, Wharfedale’s Director of Acoustic Design, describes the improvements he and his team have brought to the Diamond 200 Series:

When Wharfedale launched the very first Diamond in 1981, the company defined a new class of speaker that delivered genuine hi-fi accuracy and musical brio at a remarkably affordable price. Since then, every iteration of the famous Diamond line has adhered to that tradition but improved upon it. Our challenge with the Diamond 200 Series was to further enhance every model across the range, whilst maintaining the traditionally affordable retail prices that embody the Diamond ethos – no mean feat at a time when other manufacturers are being forced to raise the prices of equivalent ranges.

It is no coincidence that research from loudspeakers further up the Wharfedale range has crept downwards into the Diamond 200 Series. Whilst higher retail price points permit the advanced research that lets Wharfedale engineers investigate cutting-edge performance in acoustic technology, the trick is to use the benefits of this research and apply it to materials that can be produced in higher quantities with the benefit of lower cost to production.

That’s no more apparent than in the Diamond 200 Series’ new cabinet material. Research undertaken for Wharfedale’s upmarket Jade Series yielded a matrix of materials called Crystalam, which reduced the audibility of panel resonance and what our engineers call ‘cabinet hear-through’. This research showed that coherent materials, like raw MDF, have peak resonances (particularly in the midrange) that let sound out of a cabinet at volume levels that interfere with the sound from the drive units. Not surprisingly, this ‘hear-through’ causes a distinct coloration and character to the sound of such cabinets.

In Jade’s Crystalam, Wharfedale put together a matrix of non-coherent materials comprising differing densities of particleboard and MDF, substantially reducing both panel resonance and cabinet hear-through. For the Diamond 200 Series, we found that a simpler ‘sandwich’ combination of particleboard and MDF, whilst not quite reaching to the absolute standards of Crystalam, yielded similar reductions in coloration at considerably lower cost. In addition, the inner and outer layers of MDF allow a superior finish to the cabinet veneers, enhancing the aesthetic quality of the speakers in comparison to the outgoing Diamond 100 Series.

Topping this new cabinet material is a simple, one-piece baffle lacquered to a highly polished finish that cosmetically matches the silver-colored, diamond-cut drive unit surrounds. The result is an attractive appearance, with or without grilles, that makes Diamond 200 Series speakers look more expensive than they actually are, adding to their exceptional value for money.

Additional improvements inside the speakers enhance sound quality in comparison to the already highly acclaimed Diamond 100 Series. Bass unit motor systems have been further refined, with corresponding increases in magnet size, making the speakers easier to drive and boosting transient acoustic power.

Furthermore, we have taken note of how most users are placing their speakers in their rooms. These days, loudspeakers are often expected to blend into room furnishings rather than take up a significant amount of space. This is particularly true of low-cost speakers like those in the Diamond 200 Series, which are expected to fit seamlessly into average-size living rooms. For this reason, the ability to be positioned close to a rear wall is important. The balance of the Diamond 200 Series takes this into account, with the standmount speakers having a recommended minimum of 50mm to the rear wall, alongside a minimum of 200mm for the floorstanders – considerably closer positioning than is possible with many similar-sized designs.

This freedom of positioning is aided by the Slot-Loaded Distributed Port, again grown out of our research into the Jade Aperiodic bass loading system. While the Diamond 200 Series bass system is strictly bass reflex, with its attendant bonus of high sensitivity, the slot-loaded port, which uses a gap between the plinth and the port exit in the base of the cabinet, aids the pressure differential between the port and the air in the room, increasing the energy transfer and making the system more efficient. Attendant with the increase in bass driver power, Diamond 200 Series speakers now have an added degree of airflow control to the port exit, which effectively reduces turbulence in this region and reduces low-frequency distortion.

Finally, but not least of the Diamond 200 Series improvements, the crossovers have been refined over hundreds of hours of listening tests to further improve the integration between the drive units and herald a new level of realism to instruments and voices.

The result of all these technical endeavors is, we feel, the best Diamond Series yet, delivering loudspeakers which reveal a whole new level of musical detail and transient attack, drawing the listener into the musical performance in a way that is normally only expected from speakers at a considerably higher price level.

**Best practices for performance and scaling for small to medium workloads in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS):**

This article focuses on general best practices for small to medium workloads. For best practices specific to large workloads, see Performance and scaling best practices for large workloads in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

As you deploy and maintain clusters in AKS, you can use the following best practices to help you optimize performance and scaling.

In this article, you learn about:

Tradeoffs and recommendations for autoscaling your workloads.
Managing node scaling and efficiency based on your workload demands.
Networking considerations for ingress and egress traffic.
Monitoring and troubleshooting control plane and node performance.
Capacity planning, surge scenarios, and cluster upgrades.
Storage and networking considerations for data plane performance.
Application autoscaling vs. infrastructure autoscaling
Application autoscaling
Application autoscaling is useful when dealing with cost optimization or infrastructure limitations. A well-configured autoscaler maintains high availability for your application while also minimizing costs. You only pay for the resources required to maintain availability, regardless of the demand.

For example, if an existing node has space but not enough IPs in the subnet, it might be able to skip the creation of a new node and instead immediately start running the application on a new pod.

Horizontal Pod autoscaling
Implementing horizontal pod autoscaling is useful for applications with a steady and predictable resource demand. The Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) dynamically scales the number of pod replicas, which effectively distributes the load across multiple pods and nodes. This scaling mechanism is typically most beneficial for applications that can be decomposed into smaller, independent components capable of running in parallel.

The HPA provides resource utilization metrics by default. You can also integrate custom metrics or leverage tools like the Kubernetes Event-Driven Autoscaler (KEDA) (Preview). These extensions allow the HPA to make scaling decisions based on multiple perspectives and criteria, providing a more holistic view of your application's performance. This is especially helpful for applications with varying complex scaling requirements.

 Note

If maintaining high availability for your application is a top priority, we recommend leaving a slightly higher buffer for the minimum pod number for your HPA to account for scaling time.

Vertical Pod autoscaling
Implementing vertical pod autoscaling is useful for applications with fluctuating and unpredictable resource demands. The Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) allows you to fine-tune resource requests, including CPU and memory, for individual pods, enabling precise control over resource allocation. This granularity minimizes resource waste and enhances the overall efficiency of cluster utilization. The VPA also streamlines application management by automating resource allocation, freeing up resources for critical tasks.

 Warning

You shouldn't use the VPA in conjunction with the HPA on the same CPU or memory metrics. This combination can lead to conflicts, as both autoscalers attempt to respond to changes in demand using the same metrics. However, you can use the VPA for CPU or memory in conjunction with the HPA for custom metrics to prevent overlap and ensure that each autoscaler focuses on distinct aspects of workload scaling.

 Note

The VPA works based on historical data. We recommend waiting at least 24 hours after deploying the VPA before applying any changes to give it time to collect recommendation data.

Infrastructure autoscaling
Cluster autoscaling
Implementing cluster autoscaling is useful if your existing nodes lack sufficient capacity, as it helps with scaling up and provisioning new nodes.

When considering cluster autoscaling, the decision of when to remove a node involves a tradeoff between optimizing resource utilization and ensuring resource availability. Eliminating underutilized nodes enhances cluster utilization but might result in new workloads having to wait for resources to be provisioned before they can be deployed. It's important to find a balance between these two factors that aligns with your cluster and workload requirements and configure the cluster autoscaler profile settings accordingly.

The Cluster Autoscaler profile settings apply universally to all autoscaler-enabled node pools in your cluster. This means that any scaling actions occurring in one autoscaler-enabled node pool might impact the autoscaling behavior in another node pool. It's important to apply consistent and synchronized profile settings across all relevant node pools to ensure that the autoscaler behaves as expected.

Overprovisioning
Overprovisioning is a strategy that helps mitigate the risk of application pressure by ensuring there's an excess of readily available resources. This approach is especially useful for applications that experience highly variable loads and cluster scaling patterns that show frequent scale ups and scale downs.

To determine the optimal amount of overprovisioning, you can use the following formula:

txt

Copy
1-buffer/1+traffic
For example, let's say you want to avoid hitting 100% CPU utilization in your cluster. You might opt for a 30% buffer to maintain a safety margin. If you anticipate an average traffic growth rate of 40%, you might consider overprovisioning by 50%, as calculated by the formula:

txt

Copy
1-30%/1+40%=50%
An effective overprovisioning method involves the use of pause pods. Pause pods are low-priority deployments that can be easily replaced by high-priority deployments. You create low priority pods that serve the sole purpose of reserving buffer space. When a high-priority pod requires space, the pause pods are removed and rescheduled on another node or a new node to accommodate the high priority pod.

The following YAML shows an example pause pod manifest:

Node scaling and efficiency
Best practice guidance:

Carefully monitor resource utilization and scheduling policies to ensure nodes are being used efficiently.

Node scaling allows you to dynamically adjust the number of nodes in your cluster based on workload demands. It's important to understand that adding more nodes to a cluster isn't always the best solution for improving performance. To ensure optimal performance, you should carefully monitor resource utilization and scheduling policies to ensure nodes are being used efficiently.

Node images
Best practice guidance:

Use the latest node image version to ensure that you have the latest security patches and bug fixes.

Using the latest node image version provides the best performance experience. AKS ships performance improvements within the weekly image releases. The latest daemonset images are cached on the latest VHD image, which provide lower latency benefits for node provisioning and bootstrapping. Falling behind on updates might have a negative impact on performance, so it's important to avoid large gaps between versions.

Azure Linux
The Azure Linux Container Host on AKS uses a native AKS image and provides a single place for Linux development. Every package is built from source and validated, ensuring your services run on proven components.

Azure Linux is lightweight, only including the necessary set of packages to run container workloads. It provides a reduced attack surface and eliminates patching and maintenance of unnecessary packages. At its base layer, it has a Microsoft-hardened kernel tuned for Azure. This image is ideal for performance-sensitive workloads and platform engineers or operators that manage fleets of AKS clusters.

Ubuntu 2204
The Ubuntu 2204 image is the default node image for AKS. It's a lightweight and efficient operating system optimized for running containerized workloads. This means that it can help reduce resource usage and improve overall performance. The image includes the latest security patches and updates, which help ensure that your workloads are protected from vulnerabilities.

The Ubuntu 2204 image is fully supported by Microsoft, Canonical, and the Ubuntu community and can help you achieve better performance and security for your containerized workloads.

Virtual machines (VMs)
Best practice guidance:

When selecting a VM, ensure the size and performance of the OS disk and VM SKU don't have a large discrepancy. A discrepancy in size or performance can cause performance issues and resource contention.

Application performance is closely tied to the VM SKUs you use in your workloads. Larger and more powerful VMs, generally provide better performance. For mission critical or product workloads, we recommend using VMs with at least an 8-core CPU. VMs with newer hardware generations, like v4 and v5, can also help improve performance. Keep in mind that create and scale latency might vary depending on the VM SKUs you use.

Use dedicated system node pools
For scaling performance and reliability, we recommend using a dedicated system node pool. With this configuration, the dedicated system node pool reserves space for critical system resources such as system OS daemons. Your application workload can then run in a user node pool to increase the availability of allocatable resources for your application. This configuration also helps mitigate the risk of resource competition between the system and application.

Authentication for DHCP Messages
Status of this Memo
 This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for the
 Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
 improvements. Please refer to the current edition of the ""Internet
 Official Protocol Standards"" (STD 1) for the standardization state
 and status of this protocol. Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

Abstract
 This document defines a new Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
 (DHCP) option through which authorization tickets can be easily
 generated and newly attached hosts with proper authorization can be
 automatically configured from an authenticated DHCP server. DHCP
 provides a framework for passing configuration information to hosts
 on a TCP/IP network. In some situations, network administrators may
 wish to constrain the allocation of addresses to authorized hosts.
 Additionally, some network administrators may wish to provide for
 authentication of the source and contents of DHCP messages.
1. Introduction
 DHCP [1] transports protocol stack configuration parameters from
 centrally administered servers to TCP/IP hosts. Among those
 parameters are an IP address. DHCP servers can be configured to
 dynamically allocate addresses from a pool of addresses, eliminating
 a manual step in configuration of TCP/IP hosts.
 Some network administrators may wish to provide authentication of the
 source and contents of DHCP messages. For example, clients may be
 subject to denial of service attacks through the use of bogus DHCP
 servers, or may simply be misconfigured due to unintentionally
 instantiated DHCP servers. Network administrators may wish to
 constrain the allocation of addresses to authorized hosts to avoid
 denial of service attacks in ""hostile"" environments where the network

RFC 3118 Authentication for DHCP Messages June 2001
 medium is not physically secured, such as wireless networks or
 college residence halls.
 This document defines a technique that can provide both entity
 authentication and message authentication. The current protocol
 combines the original Schiller-Huitema-Droms authentication mechanism
 defined in a previous work in progress with the ""delayed
 authentication"" proposal developed by Bill Arbaugh.
1.1 DHCP threat model
 The threat to DHCP is inherently an insider threat (assuming a
 properly configured network where BOOTP ports are blocked on the
 enterprise’s perimeter gateways.) Regardless of the gateway
 configuration, however, the potential attacks by insiders and
 outsiders are the same.
 The attack specific to a DHCP client is the possibility of the
 establishment of a ""rogue"" server with the intent of providing
 incorrect configuration information to the client. The motivation
 for doing so may be to establish a ""man in the middle"" attack or it
 may be for a ""denial of service"" attack.
 There is another threat to DHCP clients from mistakenly or
 accidentally configured DHCP servers that answer DHCP client requests
 with unintentionally incorrect configuration parameters.
 The threat specific to a DHCP server is an invalid client
 masquerading as a valid client. The motivation for this may be for
 ""theft of service"", or to circumvent auditing for any number of
 nefarious purposes.
 The threat common to both the client and the server is the resource
 ""denial of service"" (DoS) attack. These attacks typically involve
 the exhaustion of valid addresses, or the exhaustion of CPU or
 network bandwidth, and are present anytime there is a shared
 resource. In current practice, redundancy mitigates DoS attacks the
 best.
1.2 Design goals
 These are the goals that were used in the development of the
 authentication protocol, listed in order of importance:
 1. Address the threats presented in Section 1.1.
 2. Avoid changing the current protocol.
Droms & Arbaugh Standards Track [Page 2]
RFC 3118 Authentication for DHCP Messages June 2001
 3. Limit state required by the server.
 4. Limit complexity (complexity breeds design and implementation
 errors).
1.3 Requirements Terminology
 The key words ""MUST"", ""MUST NOT"", ""REQUIRED"", ""SHALL"", ""SHALL NOT"",
 ""SHOULD"", ""SHOULD NOT"", ""RECOMMENDED"", ""MAY"" and ""OPTIONAL"" in this
 document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [5].
1.4 DHCP Terminology
 This document uses the following terms:
 o ""DHCP client""
 A DHCP client or ""client"" is an Internet host using DHCP to
 obtain configuration parameters such as a network address.
 o ""DHCP server""
 A DHCP server or ""server"" is an Internet host that returns
 configuration parameters to DHCP clients.

 The code for the authentication option is 90, and the length field contains the length of the protocol, RDM, algorithm, Replay Detection fields and authentication information fields in octets.The protocol field defines the particular technique for authentication used in the option. New protocols are defined as described in Section 6. The algorithm field defines the specific algorithm within the technique identified by the protocol field. The Replay Detection field is per the RDM, and the authentication information field is per the protocol in use. The Replay Detection Method (RDM) field determines the type of replay detection used in the Replay Detection field. If the RDM field contains 0x00, the replay detection field MUST be set to the value of a monotonically increasing counter. Using a counter value such as the current time of day (e.g., an NTP-format timestamp [4]) can reduce the danger of replay attacks. This method MUST be supported by all protocols. 3. Interaction with Relay Agents Because a DHCP relay agent may alter the values of the ’giaddr’ and ’hops’ fields in the DHCP message, the contents of those two fields MUST be set to zero for the computation of any hash function over the message header. Additionally, a relay agent may append the DHCP relay agent information option 82 [7] as the last option in a message to servers. If a server finds option 82 included in a received message, the server MUST compute any hash function as if the option were NOT included in the message without changing the order of options. Whenever the server sends back option 82 to a relay agent, the server MUST not include the option in the computation of any hash function over the message.  will be defined as separate protocols. 5. Delayed authentication If the protocol field is 1, the message is using the ""delayed authentication"" mechanism. In delayed authentication, the client requests authentication in its DHCPDISCOVER message and the server replies with a DHCPOFFER message that includes authentication information. This authentication information contains a nonce value generated by the source as a message authentication code (MAC) to provide message authentication and entity authentication. This document defines the use of a particular technique based on the HMAC protocol [3] using the MD5 hash [2]. 5.1 Management Issues The ""delayed authentication"" protocol does not attempt to address situations where a client may roam from one administrative domain to another, i.e., interdomain roaming. This protocol is focused on solving the intradomain problem where the out-of-band exchange of a shared secret is feasible.  Replay Detection - as defined by the RDM field K - a secret value shared between the source and destination of the message; each secret has a unique identifier (secret ID) secret ID - the unique identifier for the secret value used to generate the MAC for this message HMAC-MD5 - the MAC generating function [3, 2]. The sender computes the MAC using the HMAC generation algorithm [3] and the MD5 hash function [2]. The entire DHCP message (except as noted below), including the DHCP message header and the options field, is used as input to the HMAC-MD5 computation function. The ’secret ID’ field MUST be set to the identifier of the secret used to generate the MAC. DISCUSSION: Algorithm 1 specifies the use of HMAC-MD5. Use of a different technique, such as HMAC-SHA, will be specified as a separate protocol. Delayed authentication requires a shared secret key for each client on each DHCP server with which that client may wish to use the DHCP protocol. Each secret key has a unique identifier that can be used by a receiver to determine which secret was used to generate the MAC in the DHCP message. Therefore, delayed authentication may not scale well in an architecture in which a DHCP client connects to multiple administrative domains. 5.3 Message validation To validate an incoming message, the receiver first checks that the value in the replay detection field is acceptable according to the replay detection method specified by the RDM field. Next, the receiver computes the MAC as described in [3]. The receiver MUST set the ’MAC’ field of the authentication option to all 0s for computation of the MAC, and because a DHCP relay agent may alter the values of the ’giaddr’ and ’hops’ fields in the DHCP message, the contents of those two fields MUST also be set to zero for the computation of the MAC. If the MAC computed by the receiver does not match the MAC contained in the authentication option, the receiver MUST discard the DHCP message. Section 3 provides additional information on handling messages that include option 82 (Relay Agents). 5.4 Key utilization Each DHCP client has a key, K. The client uses its key to encode any messages it sends to the server and to authenticate and verify any messages it receives from the server. The client’s key SHOULD be initially distributed to the client through some out-of-band mechanism, and SHOULD be stored locally on the client for use in all authenticated DHCP messages. Once the client has been given its key, it SHOULD use that key for all transactions even if the client’s configuration changes; e.g., if the client is assigned a new network address. Each DHCP server MUST know, or be able to obtain in a secure manner, the keys for all authorized clients. If all clients use the same key, clients can perform both entity and message authentication for all messages received from servers. However, the sharing of keys is strongly discouraged as it allows for unauthorized clients to masquerade as authorized clients by obtaining a copy of the shared key. To authenticate the identity of individual clients, each client MUST be configured with a unique key. Appendix A describes a technique for key management. 5.5 Client considerations This section describes the behavior of a DHCP client using delayed authentication. 5.5.1 INIT state When in INIT state, the client uses delayed authentication as follows: 1. The client MUST include the authentication request option in its DHCPDISCOVER message along with a client identifier option [6] to identify itself uniquely to the server. 2. The client MUST perform the validation test described in section 5.3 on any DHCPOFFER messages that include authentication information. If one or more DHCPOFFER messages pass the validation test, the client chooses one of the offered configurations. Client behavior if no DHCPOFFER messages include authentication information or pass the validation test is controlled by local policy in the client. According to client policy, the client MAY choose to respond to a DHCPOFFER message that has not been authenticated. The decision to set local policy to accept unauthenticated messages should be made with care. Accepting an unauthenticated DHCPOFFER message can make the client vulnerable to spoofing and other attacks. If local users are not explicitly informed that the client has accepted an unauthenticated DHCPOFFER message, the users may incorrectly assume that the client has received an authenticated address and is not subject to DHCP attacks through unauthenticated messages. A client MUST be configurable to decline unauthenticated messages, and SHOULD be configured by default to decline unauthenticated messages. A client MAY choose to differentiate between DHCPOFFER messages with no authentication information and DHCPOFFER messages that do not pass the validation test; for example, a client might accept the former and discard the latter. If a client does accept an unauthenticated message, the client SHOULD inform any local users and SHOULD log the event. 3. The client replies with a DHCPREQUEST message that MUST include authentication information encoded with the same secret used by the server in the selected DHCPOFFER message. 4. If the client authenticated the DHCPOFFER it accepted, the client MUST validate the DHCPACK message from the server. The client MUST discard the DHCPACK if the message fails to pass validation and MAY log the validation failure. If the DHCPACK fails to pass validation, the client MUST revert to INIT state and returns to step 1. The client MAY choose to remember which server replied with a DHCPACK message that failed to pass validation and discard subsequent messages from that server. If the client accepted a DHCPOFFER message that did not include authentication information or did not pass the validation test, the client MAY accept an unauthenticated DHCPACK message from the server. 5.5.2 INIT-REBOOT state When in INIT-REBOOT state, the client MUST use the secret it used in its DHCPREQUEST message to obtain its current configuration to generate authentication information for the DHCPREQUEST message. The client MAY choose to accept unauthenticated DHCPACK/DHCPNAK messages if no authenticated messages were received. The client MUST treat the receipt (or lack thereof) of any DHCPACK/DHCPNAK messages as specified in section 3.2 of [1]. 5.5.3 RENEWING state When in RENEWING state, the client uses the secret it used in its initial DHCPREQUEST message to obtain its current configuration to generate authentication information for the DHCPREQUEST message. If client receives no DHCPACK messages or none of the DHCPACK messages pass validation, the client behaves as if it had not received a DHCPACK message in section 4.4.5 of the DHCP specification [1]. 5.5.4 REBINDING state When in REBINDING state, the client uses the secret it used in its initial DHCPREQUEST message to obtain its current configuration to generate authentication information for the DHCPREQUEST message. If client receives no DHCPACK messages or none of the DHCPACK messages pass validation, the client behaves as if it had not received a DHCPACK message in section 4.4.5 of the DHCP specification [1]. 5.5.5 DHCPINFORM message Since the client already has some configuration information, the client may also have established a shared secret value, K, with a server. Therefore, the client SHOULD use the authentication request as in a DHCPDISCOVER message when a shared secret value exists. The client MUST treat any received DHCPACK messages as it does DHCPOFFER messages, see section 5.5.1. 5.5.6 DHCPRELEASE message Since the client is already in the BOUND state, the client will have a security association already established with the server. Therefore, the client MUST include authentication information with the DHCPRELEASE message. 5.6 Server considerations This section describes the behavior of a server in response to client messages using delayed authentication. 5.6.1 General considerations Each server maintains a list of secrets and identifiers for those secrets that it shares with clients and potential clients. This information must be maintained in such a way that the server can: * Identify an appropriate secret and the identifier for that secret for use with a client that the server may not have previously communicated with * Retrieve the secret and identifier used by a client to which the server has provided previous configuration information Each server MUST save the counter from the previous authenticated message. A server MUST discard any incoming message which fails the replay detection check as defined by the RDM avoid replay attacks. DISCUSSION: The authenticated DHCPREQUEST message from a client in INIT-REBOOT state can only be validated by servers that used the same secret in their DHCPOFFER messages. Other servers will discard the DHCPREQUEST messages. Thus, only servers that used the secret selected by the client will be able to determine that their offered configuration information was not selected and the offered network address can be returned to the server’s pool of available addresses. The servers that cannot validate the DHCPREQUEST message will eventually return their offered network addresses to their pool of available addresses as described in section 3.1 of the DHCP specification [1]. 5.6.2 After receiving a DHCPDISCOVER message The server selects a secret for the client and includes authentication information in the DHCPOFFER message as specified in section 5, above. The server MUST record the identifier of the secret selected for the client and use that same secret for validating subsequent messages with the client. 5.6.3 After receiving a DHCPREQUEST message The server uses the secret identified in the message and validates the message as specified in section 5.3. If the message fails to pass validation or the server does not know the secret identified by the ’secret ID’ field, the server MUST discard the message and MAY choose to log the validation failure. If the message passes the validation procedure, the server responds as described in the DHCP specification. The server MUST include authentication information generated as specified in section 5.2. 5.6.4 After receiving a DHCPINFORM message The server MAY choose to accept unauthenticated DHCPINFORM messages, or only accept authenticated DHCPINFORM messages based on a site policy. When a client includes the authentication request in a DHCPINFORM message, the server MUST respond with an authenticated DHCPACK message. If the server does not have a shared secret value established with the sender of the DHCPINFORM message, then the server MAY respond with an unauthenticated DHCPACK message, or a DHCPNAK if the server does not accept unauthenticated clients based on the site policy, or the server MAY choose not to respond to the DHCPINFORM message. 6. IANA Considerations Section 2 defines a new DHCP option called the Authentication Option, whose option code is 90. This document specifies three new name spaces associated with the Authentication Option, which are to be created and maintained by IANA: Protocol, Algorithm and RDM. Initial values assigned from the Protocol name space are 0 (for the configuration token Protocol in section 4) and 1 (for the delayed authentication Protocol in section 5). Additional values from the Protocol name space will be assigned through IETF Consensus, as defined in RFC 2434 [8]. The Algorithm name space is specific to individual Protocols. That is, each Protocol has its own Algorithm name space. The guidelines for assigning Algorithm name space values for a particular protocol should be specified along with the definition of a new Protocol. For the configuration token Protocol, the Algorithm field MUST be 0. For the delayed authentication Protocol, the Algorithm value 1 is assigned to the HMAC-MD5 generating function as defined in section 5. Additional values from the Algorithm name space for Algorithm 1 will be assigned through IETF Consensus, as defined in RFC 2434. The initial value of 0 from the RDM name space is assigned to the use of a monotonically increasing value as defined in section 2. Additional values from the RDM name space will be assigned through IETF Consensus, as defined in RFC 2434. 7. References [1] Droms, R., ""Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol"", RFC 2131, March 1997.

The editors appreciate Jeff’s and Christian’s patience in reviewing this document and its earlier drafts. The ""delayed authentication"" mechanism used in section 5 is due to Bill Arbaugh. The threat model and requirements in sections 1.1 and 1.2 come from Bill’s negotiation protocol proposal. The attendees of an interim meeting of the DHC WG held in June, 1998, including Peter Ford, Kim Kinnear, Glenn Waters, Rob Stevens, Bill Arbaugh, Baiju Patel, Carl Smith, Thomas Narten, Stewart Kwan, Munil Shah, Olafur Gudmundsson, Robert Watson, Ralph Droms, Mike Dooley, Greg Rabil and Arun Kapur, developed the threat model and reviewed several alternative proposals.

Security Considerations This document describes authentication and verification mechanisms for DHCP. 9.1 Protocol vulnerabilities The configuration token authentication mechanism is vulnerable to interception and provides only the most rudimentary protection against inadvertently instantiated DHCP servers. The delayed authentication mechanism described in this document is vulnerable to a denial of service attack through flooding with DHCPDISCOVER messages, which are not authenticated by this protocol. Such an attack may overwhelm the computer on which the DHCP server is running and may exhaust the addresses available for assignment by the DHCP server. Delayed authentication may also be vulnerable to a denial of service attack through flooding with authenticated messages, which may overwhelm the computer on which the DHCP server is running as the authentication keys for the incoming messages are computed. 9.2 Protocol limitations Delayed authentication does not support interdomain authentication. A real digital signature mechanism such as RSA, while currently computationally infeasible, would provide better security. Appendix A - Key Management Technique To avoid centralized management of a list of random keys, suppose K for each client is generated from the pair (client identifier [6], subnet address, e.g., 192.168.1.0), which must be unique to that client. That is, K = MAC(MK, unique-id), where MK is a secret master key and MAC is a keyed one-way function such as HMAC-MD5. Without knowledge of the master key MK, an unauthorized client cannot generate its own key K. The server can quickly validate an incoming message from a new client by regenerating K from the client-id. For known clients, the server can choose to recover the client’s K dynamically from the client-id in the DHCP message, or can choose to precompute and cache all of the Ks a priori. By deriving all keys from a single master key, the DHCP server does not need access to clear text passwords, and can compute and verify the keyed MACs without requiring help from a centralized authentication server. To avoid compromise of this key management system, the master key, MK, MUST NOT be stored by any clients. The client SHOULD only be given its key, K. If MK is compromised, a new MK SHOULD be chosen and all clients given new individual keys. Full Copyright Statement Copyright (C) The Internet Society (2001). All Rights Reserved.

What are some current challenges with our DHCP system as it stands?","Some current challenges with the DHCP system, as described in the document, include:

*   **Insider threat:** The threat to DHCP is inherently an insider threat, assuming BOOTP ports are blocked on the enterprise’s perimeter gateways (Section 1.1).
*   **Rogue servers:** DHCP clients are susceptible to ""rogue"" servers that intend to provide incorrect configuration information, potentially leading to ""man in the middle"" or ""denial of service"" attacks (Section 1.1).
*   **Mistakenly configured servers:** DHCP clients can receive unintentionally incorrect configuration parameters from mistakenly or accidentally configured DHCP servers (Section 1.1).
*   **Invalid client masquerading:** DHCP servers face the threat of invalid clients masquerading as valid clients, which could lead to ""theft of service"" or circumvent auditing for malicious purposes (Section 1.1).
*   **Resource denial of service (DoS) attacks:** Both clients and servers are subject to DoS attacks, which typically involve exhausting valid addresses, CPU, or network bandwidth (Section 1.1).
*   **Vulnerability to interception:** The configuration token authentication mechanism, mentioned in the document, is vulnerable to interception (Section 9.1).
*   **Limited protection against inadvertently instantiated DHCP servers:** The configuration token authentication mechanism provides only rudimentary protection against unintentionally instantiated DHCP servers (Section 9.1).
*   **Denial of service through flooding:** The delayed authentication mechanism is vulnerable to DoS attacks through flooding with unauthenticated DHCPDISCOVER messages, which can overwhelm the server or exhaust available addresses (Section 9.1). It is also vulnerable to DoS through flooding with authenticated messages, which can overwhelm the server during key computation (Section 9.1).
*   **Lack of interdomain authentication:** Delayed authentication does not support interdomain authentication (Section 9.2).
*   **Computational infeasibility of strong digital signatures:** While a real digital signature mechanism like RSA would offer better security, it is currently computationally infeasible (Section 9.2).","It sounds like you're asking about the inherent vulnerabilities and challenges that exist in a standard DHCP system *without* special authentication mechanisms, which this document aims to address!

Based on the document, here are some key challenges and threats that a typical DHCP system faces:

1.  **Rogue DHCP Servers:** This is a major concern.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks:** Malicious servers can intentionally provide incorrect configuration information (like a bad IP address, gateway, or DNS server) to legitimate clients, effectively preventing them from accessing the network. This can also lead to the exhaustion of valid IP addresses.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** A rogue server could intercept client requests and provide malicious configuration, allowing an attacker to eavesdrop on or manipulate client network traffic.
    *   **Accidental Misconfiguration:** Even without malicious intent, an unintentionally set up or misconfigured DHCP server can disrupt network operations by handing out incorrect parameters.

2.  **Unauthorized Host Access / Theft of Service:**
    *   **Invalid Clients Masquerading:** An unauthorized client can pretend to be a valid client to obtain an IP address and network configuration. This could be for ""theft of service"" (using network resources without permission) or to circumvent auditing and security measures.
    *   **Hostile Environments:** In less physically secure network environments (like public Wi-Fi or college dorms), it's easier for unauthorized devices to connect and obtain network access if there's no way to constrain address allocation to *authorized* hosts only.

3.  **Denial of Service (DoS) Against DHCP Resources:**
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Attackers can flood the DHCP server with requests to exhaust the pool of available IP addresses, CPU processing power, or network bandwidth, preventing legitimate clients from getting configurations.

4.  **Lack of Message Integrity and Source Authentication:**
    *   The core issue is that, without the authentication mechanisms described in this document, there's no inherent way for a DHCP client to verify that the DHCP messages it receives (like an IP address offer) genuinely came from a legitimate DHCP server.
    *   Similarly, a DHCP server can't easily verify that an incoming request (like for an IP address) is from a truly authorized client, opening the door for the issues mentioned above.

In essence, the ""challenges"" stem from the fact that traditional DHCP is designed for ease of configuration, assuming a relatively trusted network environment. When that trust is broken (by rogue servers, unauthorized clients, or hostile network conditions), the lack of built-in authentication leaves the system vulnerable to various attacks and misconfigurations. This document aims to plug those security gaps!"

The stages of cell death differ depending on how a cell dies. When it comes to cell death, there are two main types to consider: Necrosis Vs. Apoptosis. Each of these involves a distinct process and has a distinct impact on the rest of the body.It holds utmost significance for researchers and they must choose the best Cell Separation technologies to get high-quality results.
 

 What is Cell Apoptosis?
 Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is a normal growth and development mechanism within an organism. Because the cell participates in its own death, this process is also known as “cellular suicide.” Apoptosis contributes to the balance of cell multiplication. Uncontrolled cell growth will result in tumors and other problems if cells continue to reproduce without apoptosis.
 

 What Causes Apoptosis?
 Apoptosis is also known as programmed cell death because it is usually triggered by self-generated signals within a cell. It is a normal part of the cell cycle that begins with mitosis in cell reproduction. Caspases, enzymes found in all cells that cleave specific proteins to initiate cell death, mediate this process.
 

 Apoptosis Steps
 Apoptosis occurs in a gentle and controlled manner that has no negative impact on surrounding cells. A cell will expel moisture in order to dry out and condense until fragmentation occurs. Because the cell does not release into the extracellular environment, there are no morphological changes. Apoptotic bodies are small vesicles that form to transport the contents of the cell elsewhere. This enables cells to die gently and without causing inflammation. Apoptosis is signaled by chromatin condensation in a cell’s nucleus. This allows scientists to determine whether a cell is dying naturally or unnaturally.
 

 What is Cell Necrosis?
 Necrosis is a type of cell death that occurs when cells are exposed to extreme conditions. Cells may sustain damage to their internal environment when not under normal conditions. Tissues may deteriorate quickly and harshly. As a result, necrosis is commonly defined as unintentional cell death.
 

 Causes of Necrotic Cell Death
 External factors influencing the physiology of cells in the body cause necrosis. The following are some examples of necrotic cell death causes:
 

 Bacterial infection – Bacteria are microscopic organisms that can cause infections in the body if they enter through an airway or an open wound. They may be responsible for a variety of illnesses linked to unplanned cell death.
 Fungal infection – A fungus infection, also known as mycosis, occurs when any fungus infiltrates human tissues. This could result in skin or internal system diseases, as well as unprogrammed cell death.
 Pancreatitis – Pancreatitis is an inflammation of the pancreas, a gland in the body that helps regulate hormones and digestion.
 Protein denaturation – Protein denaturation occurs when weak bonds in proteins break down, causing the cells’ ability to function properly to suffer.
 Apoptosis Vs. Necrosis
 While both necrosis and apoptosis are mechanisms involved in multicellular organism cell death, they can be distinguished in a variety of ways. Apoptosis is regarded as a naturally occurring process, whereas necrosis is regarded as a pathological process. Pathological processes are often unregulated and are caused by toxins, infections, or traumas. Apoptosis is controlled and timely, making it predictable and beneficial to the host.

 The distinction between apoptosis and necrosis is also visible in the following factors:
 

 Process – Apoptosis is characterized by the shrinking of the cytoplasm, which results in the condensation of the nucleus. Necrosis occurs when the cytoplasm and mitochondria swell, resulting in cell lysis or a rupture in the cell membrane.
 Membrane Integrity – Blebbing is a defining feature of apoptosis. Blebbing occurs when a cell’s cytoskeleton degrades and the membrane bulges outward. Apoptotic blebs can form when cytoplasmic capsules detach from dying cells. This has no effect on the membrane’s integrity. The integrity of the membrane is loosened and thus significantly reduced, if not completely lost, during necrosis.
 Organelle Behavior – Organelles can continue to function even after a cell has died due to apoptosis. Organelles swell and disintegrate during necrotic cell death. After necrosis, organelles are no longer functional.
 Scope of Affected Cells – Apoptosis is a localized process that only destroys individual or single cells. Necrosis can spread to affect adjacent cell groups, causing damage beyond the initial site.
 Bodily Influence – Apoptosis is involved in controlling cell numbers and is frequently beneficial. Apoptosis, on the other hand, can cause diseases if it becomes abnormal in either direction. Necrosis, on the other hand, is always harmful and, if left untreated, can be fatal.
 In essence, apoptosis is planned cell death in which the cell actively destroys itself in order to maintain body functionality. Necrosis is an unintentional or unplanned cell death caused by the cell’s external environment, which impedes or interferes with body functions or health.
 

 Dangers of Cell Death in a Sample
 Cell enrichment assays can be hampered by both Necrosis & Apoptosis. The goal of studying a cell population is to collect as many healthy target cells as possible. Damaged cells do not behave the same as healthy cells and thus produce insufficient results. When collecting and storing cell samples, the longer a cell is kept outside of its preferred environment, the more likely it will die from necrosis. Cells can swell and die as a result of external factors. Dead cells can clump and cause more cell death in the surrounding population when using traditional cell separation methods such as magnetic-based cell sorting.
 

 It is critical to follow protocols, use gentle cell separation methods, and use additional products for increased downstream accuracy to maintain cell health and purity during cell separation assays.
 

 Harnessing Pluriselect’s Innovative Technology: Plurispin and PluriBead
 The first method for reducing cell death is to use a gentler isolation method. Traditional separation technologies, such as magnetic bead-based sorting, can be harsh on cells and result in less-than-desirable outcomes. Let’s see what Plurispin and PluriBead can do for us.
 

 Plurispin
 The pluriSpin system is a new negative cell isolation technology that can be used to isolate cells directly from whole blood, buffy coat, or cord blood. This new method isolates viable, untouched, and highly purified cells in a single step without the use of magnets or a column. As a result, there is less chance of activating or damaging the cells of interest.
 

 PluriBead
 PluriBead is a unique cell separation technology that does not rely on magnetic components. The steps are straightforward: Your pluriBeads (containing bound target cells) are sieved through a strainer; the pluriBeads containing your target cells remain on top, while the unwanted cells pass through. You have your target cells ready after detaching.
 

 Ready to get started?
 Stop wasting your valuable samples on inefficient processes and see the difference for yourself. Pluriselect’s innovative technology provides an incredibly fast, simple workflow that allows you to confidently move to downstream processing.

Let's break down your questions!

### The Steps to Apoptosis

Apoptosis, often called ""programmed cell death"" or ""cellular suicide,"" is a very controlled and gentle process. Here's how it generally unfolds:

1.  **Signal Initiation:** Apoptosis is typically triggered by internal, self-generated signals within the cell, often mediated by enzymes called caspases. It's also signaled by the condensation of chromatin in the cell's nucleus, which scientists can use to identify naturally dying cells.
2.  **Moisture Expulsion & Condensation:** The cell actively begins to expel moisture, causing it to dry out and condense.
3.  **Fragmentation:** This condensation continues until the cell fragments into smaller pieces.
4.  **Apoptotic Body Formation:** These fragments form small, membrane-bound vesicles called ""apoptotic bodies.""
5.  **Gentle Removal:** These apoptotic bodies transport the cell's contents elsewhere, preventing their release into the extracellular environment. This process ensures that the cell dies gently, without causing inflammation or negatively impacting surrounding cells.

### Differentiating Factors Between Necrosis and Apoptosis

While both apoptosis and necrosis result in cell death, they are fundamentally different in their nature, process, and impact. Think of apoptosis as a planned, ""clean"" demolition, and necrosis as an uncontrolled, ""messy"" explosion.

Here are the key differentiating factors:

*   **Nature of the Process:**
    *   **Apoptosis:** A naturally occurring, programmed, and controlled process that is often beneficial to the organism (e.g., in development, tissue homeostasis).
    *   **Necrosis:** A pathological, unregulated process caused by external factors like injury, toxins, or infection, always harmful.
*   **Trigger:**
    *   **Apoptosis:** Usually triggered by internal signals within the cell (e.g., self-generated signals, part of the normal cell cycle).
    *   **Necrosis:** Caused by external factors influencing the cell's physiology (e.g., bacterial infection, physical trauma, lack of oxygen).
*   **Cellular Changes (Process):**
    *   **Apoptosis:** The cytoplasm shrinks, the nucleus condenses (chromatin condensation), and the cell forms ""blebs"" (outward bulges of the membrane).
    *   **Necrosis:** The cytoplasm and mitochondria swell, eventually leading to cell lysis (a rupture in the cell membrane).
*   **Membrane Integrity:**
    *   **Apoptosis:** Membrane integrity is largely maintained; even with blebbing, the cell's contents are kept within membrane-bound structures (apoptotic bodies).
    *   **Necrosis:** Membrane integrity is compromised, loosened, significantly reduced, or completely lost, leading to the release of cellular contents.
*   **Organelle Behavior:**
    *   **Apoptosis:** Organelles can often continue to function even after the cell begins to die.
    *   **Necrosis:** Organelles swell and disintegrate, losing their functionality.
*   **Scope of Affected Cells:**
    *   **Apoptosis:** A localized process that typically affects individual or single cells.
    *   **Necrosis:** Can spread and affect adjacent groups of cells, causing damage beyond the initial site.
*   **Bodily Influence:**
    *   **Apoptosis:** Generally beneficial, involved in controlling cell numbers and tissue remodeling. Abnormal apoptosis (too much or too little) can lead to disease.
    *   **Necrosis:** Always harmful to the body and, if extensive or untreated, can be fatal. It often leads to an inflammatory response.

### How a Cell Can Be Affected by Necrosis

Necrosis is a severe form of cell death that has a detrimental impact on cells and surrounding tissues. A cell can be affected in several ways:

*   **Exposure to Extreme Conditions:** Necrosis occurs when cells are exposed to conditions outside their normal environment, which can damage their internal structures.
*   **External Causes:** It's primarily driven by external factors such as:
    *   **Infections:** Bacterial or fungal infections can directly harm cells and tissues.
    *   **Inflammation:** Conditions like pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) can lead to widespread cellular damage.
    *   **Protein Denaturation:** Damage to proteins can disrupt a cell's ability to function correctly, leading to its death.
    *   **Toxins, Traumas, and Ischemia:** Exposure to harmful substances, physical injury, or a lack of blood supply/oxygen are also common causes.
*   **Morphological Changes:** The cell's internal environment is severely disrupted, leading to:
    *   **Swelling:** Both the cytoplasm and mitochondria swell significantly.
    *   **Membrane Rupture:** The cell membrane loses its integrity and eventually ruptures (cell lysis), spilling the cell's contents into the extracellular space.
    *   **Organelle Disintegration:** Organelles within the cell swell and disintegrate, becoming non-functional.
*   **Spread of Damage:** Unlike apoptosis, necrotic cell death isn't contained. The release of cellular contents can trigger an inflammatory response in the surrounding tissue and spread the damage to adjacent cell groups.
*   **Harmful to the Body:** Necrosis is always harmful and can impede normal bodily functions. If left untreated, it can have severe consequences and even be fatal.
*   **Impact on Samples:** In laboratory settings, necrotic cells can swell, clump together, and release their contents, which can further harm healthy cells in a sample, making research and diagnostic efforts difficult.

Understanding these distinctions is vital, especially for researchers who need to maintain cell health and purity in their studies using appropriate cell separation technologies."

ABSTRACT: Marijuana is perceived as a harmless drug, and its recreational use has gained popularity among young individuals. 
The concentration of active ingredients in recreational formulations has gradually increased over time, and high-potency 
illicit cannabinomimetics have become available. Thus, the consumption of cannabis in the general population is rising. 
Data from preclinical models demonstrate that cannabinoid receptors are expressed in high density in areas involved in 
cognition and behavior, particularly during periods of active neurodevelopment and maturation. In addition, growing evidence 
highlights the role of endogenous cannabinoid pathways in the regulation of neurotransmitter release, synaptic plasticity, and 
neurodevelopment. In animal models, exogenous cannabinoids disrupt these important processes and lead to cognitive and 
behavioral abnormalities. These data correlate with the higher risk of cognitive impairment reported in some observational 
studies done in humans. It is unclear whether the effect of cannabis on cognition reverts after abstinence. However, this 
evidence, along with the increased risk of stroke reported in marijuana users, raises concerns about its potential long-term 
effects on cognitive function. This scientific statement reviews the safety of cannabis use from the perspective of brain 
health, describes mechanistically how cannabis may cause cognitive dysfunction, and advocates for a more informed health 
care worker and consumer about the potential for cannabis to adversely affect the brain.

arijuana, or cannabis, was considered an illicit drug for 
decades. However, in many parts of the world, cannabis 
has been legalized for medical use or decriminalized 
for recreational or medicinal applications. This shift 
in attitude has resulted in a rapid increase in its use. It has 
been estimated that ≈183 million people in the world used 
marijuana in 20141 and that 22 million met criteria for cannabis 
use disorder in 2016.2 In addition, according to the 
2002 to 2019 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 
the proportion of the US population >12 years of age who 
used marijuana in the past year increased gradually from 

11% in 2002 to 18% in 2019.3 The use of marijuana 
has gained popularity, particularly among adolescents and 
young adults, with ≈36% of 12th graders and 43% of college 
students reporting having used it in the past year.4 In 
parallel, evidence suggests that the potency of cannabis 
products in the United States, measured by the concentration 
of the primary psychoactive constituent of marijuana, 
Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), has gradually increased 
from ≈4% in 1995 to 15% in 2018.5

memory such as the hippocampus, amygdala, and prefrontal 
cortex (PFC), particularly during periods of active 
brain development.6 Acute intoxication with cannabinoids 
can impair memory and behavioral inhibition.7 Cannabinoids 
also regulate anxiety and can produce psychosis-
like effects.6 Evidence shows that age at exposure 
may influence the effect of cannabinoids on cognitive 
function. For example, the prenatal, perinatal, and adolescent 
periods may be particularly sensitive to these 
compounds.8 Data obtained in preclinical models have 
shown that cannabis and its associated signaling pathways 
regulate neurotransmission and play an active role 
in key cerebral processes, including neuroinflammation, 
neurogenesis, neural migration, synaptic pruning, and 
white matter development.6,9 Furthermore, experimental 
data show that cannabinoids can regulate the functioning 
of different cytochrome-P450 isoforms and uridine 
5′-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferases. Thus, there is 
a potential risk for drug-to-drug interactions with medications 
commonly used by the elderly such as warfarin, 
antiarrhythmic agents, sedatives, and anticonvulsants.10 

These factors have raised concerns about the potential 
effect of cannabis on cognitive vitality. The goal of 
this scientific statement is to critically appraise the safety 
of cannabis use from the perspective of brain health. 

CANNABIS AND ENDOCANNABINOIDS 

Anandamide and 2-arachidonoyl-glycerol are endogenous 
bioactive lipids that activate 2 G-protein–coupled 
receptors designated as cannabinoid receptor type 1 
(CB1) and 2 (CB2). These lipids, called endocannabinoids, 
are not stored in vesicles but are synthesized on 
demand. The system formed by the cannabinoid receptors 
CB1 and CB2, endogenous ligands, and enzymes 
involved in their production and degradation is known as 
the endocannabinoid system (ECS). A detailed description 
of the composition and regulation of the ECS is 
beyond the scope of this publication; this topic has been 
reviewed extensively elsewhere.9,11,12 

Phytocannabinoids are exogenous cannabinoids 
extracted from flowering plants from the cannabis genus, 
including Cannabis sativa, Cannabis indica, and Cannabis 
ruderalis. Whether these are species or subspecies is 
a matter of debate. More than 100 phytocannabinoids 
have been extracted from these plants, with THC and 
cannabidiol (CBD) being the most abundant. The relative 
concentration of THC and CBD in these strains is 
variable. In general, cannabis cultivars can be classified 
according to the cannabinoid produced as chemotype 
I (THC rich), II (THC/CBD balanced), III (CBD rich), IV 
(cannabigerol rich), or V (cannabinoid free).13 

THC is a psychoactive alkaloid that signals through 
CB1 and CB2 receptors. Cannabinoid receptor type 1 
is expressed abundantly in peripheral and central neural 

cells. In the periphery, CB1 localizes to sympathetic nerve 
terminals and sensory neurons. In the central nervous 
system, it is expressed mainly in presynaptic membranes 
of excitatory and inhibitory neurons, where it regulates 
the vesicular release of dopamine, GABA, and glutamate. 
In comparison, CB2 is expressed mainly in immune cells, 
including microglia.9 

CBD is a nonpsychoactive cannabinoid that has antioxidant 
and anti-inflammatory properties. It is thought 
that CBD exerts some of the beneficial effects that 
phytocannabinoids have in Dravet syndrome and Lennox-
Gastaut syndrome. Furthermore, studies done in 
preclinical models suggest that CBD is beneficial in 
Alzheimer disease, cerebral ischemia, multiple sclerosis, 
and other neurologic disorders.9,14 The therapeutic 
potential of CBD is being investigated in different clinical 
trials. Compared with THC, CBD signals through different 
pathways but does not activate CB1 and CB2. At low 
concentration, CBD blocks the orphan G-protein–coupled 
receptor-55, the equilibrative nucleoside transporter 
1, and the transient receptor potential of melastatin type 
8 channel. It also activates the serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) 
1A receptor, the transient receptor potential of 
ankyrin type 1 channel, and α3 and α1 glycine receptors. 
At high concentration, CBD activates the nuclear peroxisome 
proliferator-activated receptor γ and the transient 
receptor potential of vanilloid types 1 and 2.12,14 

Several cannabinoids have received approval in different 
countries for the treatment of specific medical 
conditions. In addition, high-potency synthetic cannabimimetics 
such as Spice are available in the illegal market 
(Table 1).15–17 

NEUROBIOLOGICAL ACTIONS OF 
CANNABIS IN ANIMAL MODELS 

Molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the 
effects of cannabis on the developing brain are inferred 
mainly from preclinical studies that permit controlling 
for social and environmental factors that could influence 
outcomes of interest. In addition, animal models 
allow the investigation of a range of human age-related 
behavioral factors (eg, novelty and sensation seeking, 
impulsivity, risk-taking behaviors) and key stages 
of neurodevelopment that are conserved across many 
mammalian species. However, many individual (eg, species, 
strain, age) and experimental (eg, design, drug, 
dose, delivery, regimen) variables, along with objective 
end points (eg, behavioral paradigm, experimental technique), 
have contributed to equivocal findings across 
studies. Nonetheless, experimental animal models 
of prenatal and adolescent cannabis exposure have 
proved fundamental in disclosing the underlying neurobiological 
mechanisms that might explain several clinical 
neuropsychiatric outcomes outlined here.

Animal models have been used to examine the role of 
the ECS in the modulation of synaptic plasticity, a process 
that allows the brain to change and adapt to new 
information.18 The ECS modulates synaptic plasticity by 
affecting the strength of interneuronal connections and, 
ultimately, the functioning of neuronal networks. From 
the mechanistic standpoint, THC activates cannabinoid 
receptors in the brain, thus interfering with physiological 
actions of endocannabinoids. Spatial and time resolution 
of endocannabinoid production is pivotal for correct processing 
of different brain functions such as higher-order 
cognition, memory, reward, mood, and stress sensitiv


ity.8,19,20

 Consequently, THC, activating nonspecifically 
CB1 receptors in the brain, disrupts the fine-tuning of 
synaptic activity exerted by endocannabinoids, eventually 
impairing connectivity of neuronal networks and 
brain functionality. 

Although incompletely understood, the way in which 
THC disrupts memory and learning may be through 
its differential effect on neurotransmitter release and 
binding to CB1 receptors.19 For example, THC activates 

CB1 receptors located on GABAergic interneurons, 
which represent nearly three-quarters of the brain CB1 
receptors, and astrocytes, resulting in the release of 
hippocampal glutamate. Concomitantly, THC affects 
the transmission of other neurotransmitters involved 
in the modulation of memory such as acetylcholine, 
adenosine, and serotonin.19,20 Furthermore, THC activation 
of CB1 receptors present on mitochondria leads to 
decreased cellular respiration and ATP supply.19 ATP is 
fundamental in maintaining and regulating neurotransmission, 
and its reduction might contribute to THC-
induced cognitive deficits. 

Repeated exposure to cannabis, especially during 
the adolescent developmental period, may be especially 
harmful to brain health and cause structural, molecular, 
and functional alterations of brain circuits, particularly in 
the PFC and hippocampus.8,21,22 Long-term THC exposure 
induces CB1 receptor downregulation and desensitization 
that appear more intense and widespread after 
adolescent exposure as opposed to adulthood exposure.
22 Data obtained in experimental models showed 
that these effects could have implications for neurodevelopmental 
processes in which the ECS plays a role. 
Accordingly, long-term THC exposure during adolescence 
may disrupt dynamic changes occurring in glutamatergic 
and GABAergic systems, leading to excessive 
synaptic pruning (ie, loss of synaptic contacts), long-term 
dysfunction in prefrontal excitatory/inhibitory balance, 
and desynchronization of PFC neuronal networks, which 
also dysregulate the mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway 
(Figure).23 These changes may represent the molecular 
underpinnings of cognitive deficits and altered emotional 
reactivity and social behavior observed long after adolescent 
long-term THC exposure.22 Long-term changes 
in brain functionality induced by THC exposure during 
adolescence might also arise from epigenetic modifications 
with a marked reprogramming of the transcriptome, 
affecting mainly genes related to synaptic plasticity processes.
8,19 These effects have not been reported after 
adult THC exposure.19 

In addition to the effects on neuron cellular and sub-
cellular components, recent evidence suggests that 
alterations in glial cells have a key role in the actions of 
THC.24 Long-term THC exposure activates microglia and 
astrocytes to produce inflammatory cytokines. For example, 
long-term administration of THC during adolescence 
increased the microglial expression of the proinflammatory 
mediators tumor necrosis factor-α, inducible nitric 
oxide synthase, and cyclooxygenase-2 by 60%, 130%, 
and 80%, respectively, and reduced the expression of 
the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 by 30% in 
the PFC. The resulting neuroinflammatory response was 
associated with memory impairment during adulthood.25 

Dose constitutes an additional important variable to 
consider. Most studies describe detrimental effects of

EFFECT OF PRENATAL EXPOSURE TO 
CANNABINOID AGONISTS 

A recent study examined associations between prenatal 
cannabis exposure (PCE) and various indicators of mental 
and neurocognitive health in a sample of 11489 youth.26 
Self-report of maternal cannabis use during pregnancy 
was associated with various adverse outcomes among 
youth at 9 to 10 years of age, including poorer performance 
on tests of neurocognitive functioning and total 
intracranial volumes, even after controlling for potential 
confounders. Several reviews describe PCE sequelae 
in preclinical models.8,24,27–30 Here, we focus on mechanistic 
insights inferred from animal studies recapitulating 
the neuropsychiatric features of clinical outcomes.31 
The detrimental effect of PCE on cognitive processing 
and emotional regulation of the progeny has been 
ascribed to changes in intrinsic and synaptic properties 
and plasticity of cortical (eg, PFC), limbic (eg, amygdala, 
hippocampus), and midbrain (eg, ventral tegmentum) 
regions. Changes in the balance of excitatory and inhibitory 
input strength, along with alterations in how principal 
neurons and interneurons receive, integrate, and convey 

information, have been observed in these neuroanatomic 
areas (Figure).8,24,27–30

 Aberrant glutamatergic function 
is a common hallmark, as indexed by changes in the 
expression and function of ionotropic and metabotropic 
receptors and in dynamic regulation of glutamate levels 
by glutamate transporters at both synaptic cleft and 
extrasynaptic spaces. These changes depend largely on 
the alterations of endocannabinoid signaling pathways 
caused by exogenous cannabinoids during development 
and throughout ontogenesis (eg, neural proliferation, 
survival, directional axonal growth).8,24,27–30 Defects in 
ECS function also may account for the interneuronopathy 
observed in many brain regions of PCE offspring, 
a phenomenon often more prominent in female than in 
male animals.8,27–29 In the PFC, this persistent inhibitory 
circuit deficit also is associated with a delayed switch of 
GABA from its excitatory role early in development to a 
classic inhibitory function exerted throughout the central 
nervous system later in life.8,29 This is particularly relevant 
because the GABA switch represents a critical milestone 
during neurodevelopment. Any alteration in the normal 
and predictable temporal sequence of these periods 
such as delays, stalls, or accelerations imposed by PCE 
may lead to perturbations of offspring cognitive processing 
and emotional behavior.8,29 

It was observed that marijuana use leads to dysregulation 
of monoaminergic pathways and stress response 


systems.8,27–29 PCE hampers the maturation of mono-
amines, which also exert trophic actions on target neurons 
and afferent terminals. This phenomenon may depend on 
epigenetic modifications and may be implicated in aberrant 
reward signaling. Furthermore, PCE is associated 
with an endophenotype in the offspring, which displays 
protracted dysregulation of stress responsivity that is 
not explained by glucocorticoid levels. A susceptibility 
to acute and chronic stress is tied to many psychiatric 
disorders, ranging from depressed mood and psychosis 
to substance use disorders and anxiety. A deeper 
understanding of how PCE interferes with endocannabinoid 
signaling during neurodevelopment would allow us 
to explore potential interventions aimed at restoring or 
reprogramming the hierarchical progression of developmental 
milestones. 

EFFECTS OF MARIJUANA USE ON HUMAN 
COGNITION 

Acute intoxication from marijuana is associated with 
impairment of working and episodic memory, behavioral 
disinhibition, and impulsivity, which can affect performance 
in real-world activities.6 For example, a meta-analysis 
from 2016 showed that the odds of being involved 
in a motor vehicle accident was increased 36% in cannabis 
users relative to nonusers.32 In addition, a crossover 
clinical trial published in 2020 investigated the effect of 
different cannabis products in relation to on-road driving 
tests. The SD of lateral position, a measure of lane weaving, 
swerving, and overcorrection, was 20.29 cm at 40 to 
100 minutes after inhalation of THC-dominant cannabis 
and 21.09 cm after inhalation of a mixture of THC and 
CBD. It is interesting to note that the SD of lateral position 
after inhalation of CBD-dominant cannabis was similar 
to that in the placebo group (18.21 cm versus 18.26 
cm).33 These observations illustrate the differential short-
term effect of THC and CBD on cognition. Evidence also 
suggests that the short-term effects of cannabinoids are 
transient and can be influenced by the development of 
tolerance and the use of other drugs. 

The long-term effect of cannabis on cognition, however, 
is less well established. Recent meta-analyses 
report residual effects of cannabis use on neurocognition, 
consistent with prior research.34 A meta-analysis by 
Lovell et al35 in 2020 focused on adult near-daily cannabis 
use for >2 years and found global neurocognition 
among users (n=849) to be about one-quarter of an 
SD worse than that of nonusers (n=764). Four of the 7 
domains investigated (decision-making, verbal learning, 
retention, executive function) showed significant effect 
sizes ranging from Hedges g=−0.52 to −0.18. A meta-
analysis of cannabis users <26 years of age (n=2152) 
and nonusers (n=6575) also showed a one-quarter of an 
SD difference in global neurocognitive performance but 

with more specific domains affected,36 albeit with smaller 
effect size compared with that found by Lovell et al.35 
Both lacked support for worse neurocognition in early 
adolescence in that neither found that age at onset of 
cannabis use influenced the association between exposure 
and cognitive performance. 

In contrast to these meta-analyses, large longitudinal 
studies provide stronger causal inferences by 
examining change over time. In the CARDIA study 
(Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults), 
3385 participants 18 to 30 years of age were followed 
up longitudinally. Marijuana use was assessed periodically 
in the 25-year follow-up. In addition, cognitive 
assessment was completed 25 years after inception. In 
this study, cumulative years of exposure to marijuana 
was associated with worse verbal memory (0.13 lower 
SD in the verbal memory test for each additional 5 
years of exposure to marijuana).37 Longitudinal co-twin 
studies use a research design that additionally controls 
for shared variance from genetic and environmental 
factors. Two large longitudinal twin studies (n=3066) 
with neurocognitive measures collected before (at 
9–12 years of age) and after (17–20 years of age) 
cannabis exposure reported that declines in vocabulary 
and general knowledge were associated with being a 
cannabis user but not with amount of cannabis consumed.
38 Twins discordant for cannabis use showed no 
differences in IQ declines. Thus, differences were likely 
caused by shared risk factors. Using a similar design, 
Meier et al39 reported that lower IQ predated cannabis 
use with no evidence of actual IQ declines among 
1989 twins assessed at 5, 12, and 18 years of age. 
Ross et al40 evaluated other aspects of neurocognition 
among 856 individual twins and reported only 1 
within-family effect of 70 tested. Specifically, frequency 
of cannabis use at 17 years of age was associated with 
poorer executive functioning at 23 years of age, but 
executive functioning problems predating cannabis use 
could not be ruled out. 

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques demonstrate 
differential associations of cannabis use with 
brain structure and function. In terms of brain structure, 
alterations related to cannabis use have been mixed. In 
a longitudinal study including 1598 MRIs done in adolescents 
at baseline and the 5-year follow-up, a dose-
dependent association was observed between cannabis 
use and PFC thinning.41 On the other hand, although a 
meta-analysis found that regular cannabis consumption 
was associated with smaller hippocampal (standardized 
mean difference, 0.14 [95% CI, 0.02–0.27]), 
medial orbitofrontal cortex (standardized mean difference, 
0.30 [95% CI, 0.15–0.45]), and lateral orbitofrontal 
cortex (standardized mean difference, 0.19 [95% CI, 
0.07–0.32]) volumes relative to nonuse, brain volumes 
were not associated with cannabis use duration and dosage.
42 Other large studies have reported null effects. In 2 

e180 April 2022 Stroke. 2022;53:e176–e187. DOI: 10.1161/STR.0000000000000396 


large twin samples from the United States (n=474) and 
Australia (n=622), cannabis use was unrelated to volumes 
of the thalamus, caudate nucleus, putamen, pallidum, 
hippocampus, amygdala, and nucleus accumbens.43 
A multisite study of cortical surface measures (n=262) 
reported no difference in cortical thickness, surface area, 
and gyrification index in cannabis users versus nonusers, 
in cannabis dependence versus nondependence 
versus nonusers, and in early adolescent versus late 
adolescent onset of cannabis use versus nonuse.44 Thus, 
brain structural abnormalities related to cannabis use are 
inconsistent. 

Functional MRI studies report more robust effects, 
particularly after prolonged cannabis use. A meta-analysis 
of task-based functional MRI studies in current adult 
and adolescent users found abnormalities in activation 
in both age groups. Relative to nonusing control subjects, 
adult cannabis users had greater brain activation 
in the superior (seed-based d mapping [SDM-Z], 1.561; 
P<0.002) and posterior (SDM-Z, 1.479; P<0.003) transverse 
temporal and inferior frontal gyri (SDM-Z, 1.568; 
P<0.002) and less activation in the striatum (SDM-Z, 
−1.843; P<0.001), insula (SDM-Z, −1.637; P<0.001), 
and middle frontal gyrus across different tasks. Adolescent 
cannabis users also had greater activation in the 
inferior parietal gyrus (SDM-Z, 1.06; P<0.001) and putamen 
(SDM-Z, 1.008; P<0.001) compared with nonusers 
across various tasks, suggesting compensatory neuroadaptive 
mechanisms.45 These functional abnormalities 
persist despite cessation of cannabis use and beyond 
the period when THC metabolites are detectable. A 
meta-analysis of the same adolescent studies found that 
>25-day abstinent adolescent cannabis users exhibited 
greater activation in the right inferior frontal gyrus in 
addition to other areas relevant for executive functioning 
and self-regulatory mechanisms.46 

Several recent studies examined cannabis effects in 
populations with premorbid clinical risk factors and those 
using medical marijuana. A meta-analysis focused only on 
cannabis users with psychosis <25 years of age (n=529) 
and nonusing control subjects with psychosis (n=901). 
In this study, there were significant differences in 3 of 11 
domains assessed (premorbid IQ, Hedges g=0.40 [standardized 
effect size]; current IQ, Hedges g=−0.17; working 
memory, Hedges g=−0.76).47 Among a sample of 
215 adult patients with chronic pain provided daily herbal 
cannabis containing 12.5% THC for 1 year, no significant 
neurocognitive differences were found compared with 216 
control subjects.48 This is in line with a study of patients 
with multiple sclerosis in response to oral dronabinol that 
found no significant differences in MRI-derived measures, 
including annual percentage of brain volume change and 
occurrence of new lesions, after 12 months of use.49 These 
clinical trials suggest no significant adverse effect of THC 
on neurocognitive symptoms in specific clinical populations. 

EFFECTS OF MARIJUANA USE ON 
CEREBROVASCULAR RISK AND DISEASE 
Cerebrovascular Risk Factors 

Similar to the literature linking marijuana use with cardiovascular 
outcomes,10 evidence that marijuana consumption 
increases the prevalence of specific cerebrovascular 
risk factors and disease is limited by a preponderance 
of observational studies, cross-sectional studies, case 
reports, and case series prone to potential publication 
and other biases. Postulated adverse effects of marijuana 
use may include sympathetic nervous system activation, 
blood pressure changes, platelet activation, and 
electrophysiological effects.50–52 Concomitant tobacco 
smoking and other substance use and abuse possibly 
contribute to these effects, which may be short term and 
have been studied mostly in low-risk populations such 
as younger adults. These factors may explain why many 
longitudinal studies linking marijuana use and cardiovascular 
or metabolic risk factors have been negative after 
multivariable adjustment for unhealthy behaviors such as 
diet and tobacco smoking.53–55 

Hypertension, in particular, is an important risk factor 
for ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, and subarachnoid 
hemorrhage. With marijuana use, the most common 
acute reaction in humans is a decrease in blood pressure 
resulting from cannabinoid effects on the vasculature and 
autonomic nervous system.52 Despite this physiological 
reaction, limited studies using the National Health and 
Nutrition Examination Survey showed a modest association 
of recent cannabis use with higher systolic blood 
pressure and higher prevalence of hypertension among 
current users 30 to 59 years of age.56 Heavy users, 
defined as use of marijuana or hashish in >20 of the 
past 30 days, had higher odds of abnormal blood pressure 
compared with never-users. Although this difference 
remained statistically significant after adjustment for 
age, sex, race, ethnicity, body mass index, education, and 
survey year, it was no longer statistically significant after 
additional adjustment for current tobacco and binge alcohol 
use (adjusted odds ratio, 1.47 [95% CI, 0.99–2.16]).57 
The relationship between marijuana use and elevated 
blood pressure, especially among heavy users, may drive 
longer-term associations with cerebrovascular outcomes, 
although this mechanism remains to be studied. 

Prior cardiovascular disease such as myocardial infarction 
(MI) or atrial fibrillation (AF) is also an important risk 
factor for stroke.58 Case reports of MI after marijuana 
use are mainly among young adults who lack vascular 
risk factors, with onset of MI shortly after use.59 Risk of 
MI was elevated 4.8-fold within an hour after smoking 
marijuana compared with periods of nonuse. This association 
demonstrates the potential role of marijuana as 
an acute trigger for cardiovascular disease.60 Over 25 
years of follow-up, among 5113 adult participants in 

Stroke. 2022;53:e176–e187. DOI: 10.1161/STR.0000000000000396 April 2022 e181 


the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults 
study, cumulative or recent marijuana use was not associated 
with coronary heart disease, stroke, or cardiovascular 
disease mortality.61 This finding contrasts with a 
population-based, multi-institutional database study that 
observed an increased risk of 3-year cumulative incidence 
of MI among marijuana users compared with control 
subjects (1.37% vs 0.54%; relative risk, 2.54 [95% 
CI, 2.45–2.61]).62 

Similarly, marijuana use appears to be a trigger for AF. 
Data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample show that the 
percentage of individuals with cannabis use disorder discharged 
in the postlegalization period (2010–2014) with 
the diagnosis of arrhythmia increased 31%.63 However, in 
a study of patients hospitalized for heart failure, marijuana 
users had a reduced odds of AF compared with nonusers 
(adjusted odds ratio, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.77–0.98]).50 Simultaneous 
use of cocaine, stimulants, and other drugs may 
be responsible for observations of AF among marijuana 
users, although this remains to be fully studied outside of 
observational and cross-sectional reports. 

Risk of Stroke and Transient Ischemic Attack 

Several case reports and case series mostly in young 
individuals suggest a relationship between recent and 
heavy cannabis use and risk of stroke.64–66 In contrast, 
and as reviewed below, findings among case-control 
studies,67 population-based studies,68 and studies conducted 
using outpatient69,70 or inpatient71,72 national databases 
or hospital electronic health records73 have been 
equivocal, depending on the study design, covariates 
considered in the analysis, and source of the population 
being studied. Inconsistent associations also can be 
attributable to the presence of comparison groups and 
whether adjustment of other important risk factors was 
considered, along with attention to potential confounding 
by other risk factor and lifestyle features between cannabis 
users and nonusers. 

In 1 case-control study using cannabis urine screens 
to identify cannabis users, the authors found an association 
between cannabis use and the risk of ischemic 
stroke and transient ischemic attack, but the association 
was not significant when tobacco use was included as 
a covariate (adjusted odds ratio, 1.59 [95% CI, 0.71– 
3.70]) among subjects 18 to 55 years of age with and 
without stroke.67 Similarly, after adjustment for cigarette 
smoking and alcohol use, another study found no association 
between cannabis use in young adulthood and 
the occurrence of fatal and nonfatal stroke later in life 
among Swedish men in up to 38 years of follow-up.68 

Data from studies that have examined more specifically 
the dose or amount of cannabis consumed within 
a designated time frame suggest that regular cannabis 
use may increase the risk of stroke. Using data from 
population-based surveys, investigators have reported 

that when no cannabis use was compared with heavy 
cannabis use in the past year, cannabis use was associated 
with an increased risk for the occurrence of nonfatal 
stroke and transient ischemic attack.70 Similarly, another 
study found that recent (within the past 30 days) and 
frequent (>10 d/mo) cannabis use was associated with 
increased risk for the occurrence of stroke compared 
with nonuse, whereas less frequent cannabis use (≤10 
d/mo or less than weekly in the past year) was not associated 
with increased risk.69,70 

Using several International Classification of Diseases, 
Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes for marijuana use, 
a Nationwide Inpatient Sample study found that cannabis 
use among men and women hospitalized between 2004 
and 2011 was associated with a 17% increased relative risk 
for acute ischemic stroke in a multivariable-adjusted analysis. 
Concomitant use of tobacco with cannabis increased 
the risk to 31%.71 Similarly, a separate study using the 
Nationwide Inpatient Sample but between 2009 and 2010 
observed a higher odds of stroke among cannabis users 
(odds ratio, 1.24 [95% CI, 1.14–1.34]).72 In contrast, investigators 
using electronic health record data from patients 
admitted to a single center between 2015 and 2017 found 
that testing positive for cannabis use was not associated 
with the risk of ischemic stroke compared with testing 
negative, even after adjustment for numerous confounders, 
including age, cigarette smoking, and comorbidities.73 

There may be certain populations or scenarios in which 
cannabis use can be meaningfully linked to stroke. A 
study of a large longitudinal cohort of Canadian pregnant 
women that included >1 million participants between 
1989 and 2019 with follow-up at 30 years observed 
that cannabis use disorder was associated with a doubling 
of risk for hemorrhagic stroke (hazard ratio, 2.08 
[95% CI, 1.07–4.05]) but no increased risk for ischemic 
or other cerebrovascular disease.74 Because of the theoretical 
vasoactive effect of cannabis, its use has been 
implicated in some cases of reversible cerebral vasoconstriction 
syndrome, with 6 of 24 nonidiopathic reversible 
cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome cases at a Colorado 
stroke center attributed to marijuana use.75 In addition, an 
elevated risk of stroke from intracranial arterial stenosis 
has been described among young cannabis users 18 to 
45 years of age wherein vasospasm or reversible cerebral 
vasoconstriction syndrome may be a potential mechanism.
76 Studies done in experimental models have shown 
that cannabinoids exert complex effects on cardiac contractility, 
vascular tone, and atherogenesis. Both vasodilatation 
and vasoconstriction responses were observed, 
depending on the experimental model and cannabinoid 
used. CB1 activation promotes inflammation, upregulates 
the production of reactive oxygen species, and activates 
proapoptotic pathways in endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes. 
In addition, it induces endothelial dysfunction and 
vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration. 
These processes have been linked to cardiac dysfunction

and the development of atherosclerosis.52 This is in contrast 
to the atheroprotective role associated with CB2. 

Acute cardiovascular events and stroke also have 
been reported in patients using synthetic cannabinoids.77 
Spice is associated with idiopathic thrombocytopenic 
purpura, which increases the risk of major hemorrhage.78 
In addition, intracranial hemorrhage in Spice users has 
been linked to the presence of brodifacoum, an adulterant 
considered a superwarfarin.79 

EDUCATION AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS 

Our understanding of the ramifications of cannabis consumption 
on brain health is limited but rapidly evolving. 
Observational studies have produced conflicting results in 
relation to the effect of marijuana on different outcomes 
of interest, including hypertension, AF, MI, and cognition. 
Several methodological factors may explain these apparent 
contradictions. First, given its historical classification as an 
illicit drug, the use of marijuana has been underreported for 
generations. The inclusion of marijuana users in the control 
group of observational studies that rely on self-reported use 
could underestimate its effect on brain health. Second, several 
behaviors such as smoking and alcohol use are associated 
with marijuana consumption and can influence stroke 
risk and brain connectivity.80,81 The often missing information 
on frequency of exposure to these factors limits our 
ability to determine with accuracy the independent effect of 
marijuana. Third, the time of exposure, frequency of use, and 
bioavailability of marijuana, which is affected by the route 
of administration, diet, and concomitant use of medications 
that may affect its metabolism, are reported inconsistently.10 
Fourth, THC and CBD have different pharmacological 
effects. Although the use of THC has been associated 
with detrimental effects, CBD appears to have therapeutic 
potential in some neurologic disorders.9 The absolute and 
relative concentrations of these compounds differ according 
to the strain of cannabis plant and the methodology 
used to extract the active ingredients.82 Fifth, the gradual 
increase in the potency of marijuana used recreationally 
limits the relevance of older studies.5 Sixth, different factors 
impede the development of long-term placebo-controlled 
studies, including ethical reasons and the psychotropic 
effect of THC, which cannot be blinded. 

Social media may emphasize a beneficial role for marijuana, 
and the general population may perceive it as a 
harmless drug. However, the emerging evidence linking 
marijuana use to cardiovascular events and stroke, 
as well as the potential and demonstrated drug-to-drug 
interactions between marijuana and medications commonly 
used in the general population, calls for caution 
and highlights the potential importance of active surveillance 
programs.10,83 In addition, the high density of cannabinoid 
receptors in areas involved in executive function 
and memory, the dose-dependent detrimental effect of 
THC on working and episodic memory, and the role of

Cognition domain specific. 
Neuroimaging studies have shown structural changes in 
cannabis users; however, the results are inconsistent. 
Functional changes may be observed in areas of the brain 
involved in cognition among cannabis users. 
Early exposure to cannabis may have a negative effect on 
cognitive function. 
Effects of Several studies have described an association between 
Marijuana cannabis use and increased risk of stroke.

Disease 
Cigarette smoking is common in cannabis users and may 
be an important modifier or confounder of the relationship 
between cannabis use and stroke risk. 
Given the potential role of cannabis as a vasoactive 
substance and its potential role in cardiac pathology and 
atherosclerosis development, cannabis use also may 
increase stroke risk via reversible cerebral vasoconstriction 
syndromes or may indirectly increase stroke risk. 
It is possible that differences among some study findings 
may be attributable to the years in which population cohorts 
were studied or recruited because most population cohorts 
were assembled before 2012. Over the past decade, strains 
of cannabis have been evolving, resulting in plants with high 
THC concentrations and some preparations that may have 
synthetic cannabinoids such as Spice, which may influence 
the association of cannabis use with stroke. 
Education The cumulative evidence collected in clinical and preclinical 
and Future studies suggests that the consumption of marijuana can have 
Directions a detrimental effect on brain health. The exact ramifications, 
however, have not been precisely established. 
Emerging evidence questions the widely accepted belief 
that marijuana is innocuous and suggests that cannabis, 
particularly THC, negatively affects brain health through 
direct and indirect mechanisms. 
Health care professionals and consumers should receive 
education on the potential beneficial and harmful effects 
associated with the use of marijuana, including the 
increased risk of stroke and cognitive decline. 

CBD indicates cannabidiol; PFC, prefrontal cortex; and THC, 
Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol. 

cannabinoid-associated biochemical pathways on synaptic 
plasticity and neuronal development raise concern that 
long-term exposure to marijuana may affect brain health.

marijuana resolve completely after months of abstinence. 
However, the disruption of endocannabinoid signaling 
pathways during the prenatal and perinatal periods and 
in adolescence may be detrimental to neurodevelopment.
6,8,9 Key points discussed in this scientific statement 
are summarized in Table 2. It should be noted that the 
overarching goal of this scientific statement was to discuss 
mechanisms by which marijuana use could influence 
brain health. However, as the field is developing, several 
important aspects require additional research. As an 
example, there is limited information comparing the differential 
effect of recreational, illicit, and medicinal uses 
of marijuana, as well as the type of cannabis product consumed. 
Similarly, the modulatory effects of social determinants 
of health and race and ethnicity on the interaction 
of brain health and marijuana use are largely unexplored. 
The latter area of research may be particularly important 
because communities of color in the United States may 
be disproportionately affected by natural and synthetic 
cannabinoids in relation to use and exposure and the 
legal implications of criminalization of marijuana.84 

Public health efforts should be considered to raise 
awareness about the potential negative effects associated 
with the use of marijuana in the general population. 
Possible strategies include the use of standardized concentrations 
of biologically active components and health 
warning labels on available formulations. In addition, the 
use of marijuana should be individualized and closely 
monitored. Health care professionals and patients should 
receive unbiased education about the potential consequences 
of medicinal, recreational, and illicit marijuana 
use on brain health, particularly when the exposure occurs 
during vulnerable vital periods. It also may be important 
for professionals to monitor cognitive performance of

USER REQUEST:
What is the clinical consensus on whether THC affects the brain during adolescence?","Repeated exposure to cannabis, particularly during the adolescent developmental period, may be especially harmful to brain health and cause structural, molecular, and functional alterations of brain circuits, specifically in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (Testai et al., p. e178). Long-term Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) exposure during adolescence can disrupt dynamic changes in glutamatergic and GABAergic systems, leading to excessive synaptic pruning, long-term dysfunction in prefrontal excitatory/inhibitory balance, and desynchronization of PFC neuronal networks, which may dysregulate the mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway (Testai et al., p. e178). These changes are considered the molecular underpinnings of cognitive deficits and altered emotional reactivity and social behavior observed long after adolescent long-term THC exposure (Testai et al., p. e178). The disruption of endocannabinoid signaling pathways during adolescence may be detrimental to neurodevelopment (Testai et al., p. e183).

The cumulative evidence from clinical and preclinical studies suggests that marijuana consumption, particularly THC, can have a detrimental effect on brain health, especially when exposure occurs during vulnerable vital periods like adolescence (Testai et al., p. e183, Table 2).","Based on the American Heart Association's (AHA) scientific statement, there is a clear **clinical consensus of significant concern regarding the detrimental effects of THC on the adolescent brain.** The document emphasizes that adolescence is a particularly vulnerable period for brain development.

Here's a breakdown of the key points supporting this consensus:

1.  **Vulnerable Developmental Period:** The adolescent brain is highly sensitive to cannabinoids because cannabinoid receptors are expressed in high density in areas crucial for executive function, memory (like the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala), and overall brain development and maturation. THC interferes with the natural endocannabinoid system, which plays a vital role in these processes.

2.  **Neurobiological Alterations (Preclinical Evidence):**
    *   **Structural, Molecular, and Functional Changes:** Animal models consistently show that repeated or long-term THC exposure during adolescence leads to structural, molecular, and functional alterations in brain circuits, particularly in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus.
    *   **Synaptic Plasticity Disruption:** THC disrupts the ""fine-tuning"" of synaptic activity, impacting how neurons communicate and adapt.
    *   **Excessive Synaptic Pruning:** Adolescent THC exposure may lead to excessive synaptic pruning (loss of connections) and dysregulation of excitatory/inhibitory balance in the PFC.
    *   **Neuroinflammation:** Long-term THC use in adolescence has been linked to increased pro-inflammatory mediators in the brain, associated with memory impairment in adulthood.
    *   **Lasting Effects:** These changes can represent the underlying mechanisms for cognitive deficits and altered emotional and social behavior observed long after adolescent THC exposure. Epigenetic modifications (changes in gene expression) have also been noted, which are not typically seen with adult exposure.

3.  **Human Cognitive Effects:**
    *   **Impaired Cognition:** While the long-term effects are still being precisely established, several human studies suggest residual effects on neurocognition. Meta-analyses have shown a difference in global neurocognitive performance in cannabis users under 26 years old.
    *   **Structural Changes:** Longitudinal studies in adolescents have observed a dose-dependent association between cannabis use and prefrontal cortex thinning.
    *   **Functional Brain Changes:** Functional MRI studies indicate altered brain activation patterns in adolescent cannabis users, suggesting compensatory mechanisms or persistent functional abnormalities that can even endure after abstinence.
    *   **Specific Deficits:** Impairments in working and episodic memory, behavioral disinhibition, and impulsivity are associated with acute marijuana intoxication. For populations with premorbid risk factors (e.g., psychosis), cannabis use has been linked to significant differences in current IQ and working memory.

4.  **Overall Conclusion and Recommendations:** The AHA statement concludes that the **cumulative evidence from both clinical and preclinical studies strongly suggests that marijuana consumption, particularly THC, can have a detrimental effect on brain health, especially during vulnerable developmental periods like adolescence.** It advocates for caution, active surveillance programs, and unbiased education for healthcare professionals and the public about these potential adverse effects, including the increased risk of cognitive decline.

In essence, while research is ongoing and some specific findings can be nuanced (e.g., complex interplay of shared risk factors in twin studies for IQ), the overarching clinical perspective is one of significant concern regarding THC's negative impact on the developing adolescent brain."
"DOCUMENT:
The origin of forensic medicine remains lost in a distant past, whenever the principles of medical sciences met those of law and justice (1,2). Perhaps it began with the Code of Hammurabi (1792–1750 BCE), which imposed sanctions for errors in medical and surgical practices. The same type of punishment also existed in Persia. Later on, the Visigoths promulgated laws that punished poisoning, infanticide, and homicide. Described as a medical trunk that serves the administration of justice, forensic medicine has different branches. Forensic pathology is probably the most emblematic one. Known in many Latin countries as tanathology (from the Greek word thanatos, meaning “death’s god”), definitions of forensic pathology are often so broad that they would fit better into forensic medicine as a whole than in this single branch. For Di Maio (3), it is “a branch of medicine that applies the principles and knowledge of the medical sciences in the field of law.” An even larger conception of forensic pathology (4) considers it the study of diseases and injuries of the community, because it involves the knowledge of diagnosis and treatment in every medical specialty, but also requires information in many nonmedical areas, such as chemistry, physics, criminalistics and police sciences, motor vehicle and highway conception, politics, sociology, and even the way of life of a society. Closer to its objectives and limits, Williams et al. (5) define forensic pathology as a specialized branch of pathology (pathology being the study by scientific methods of disease and tissue injury) that relates within a legal framework to the effects of trauma, poisoning, occupational hazards, and natural disease. Introduction to Forensic Medicine 15 Forensic dissections of bodies began in the 13th century at the University of Bologna in Italy by a surgeon and teacher of anatomy, Saliceto (6). Surprisingly, these forensic dissections appeared before the hospital autopsies that started by the end of the 19th century with Rokitansky, Virchow, and the advent of the pathogenesis of diseases and cellular pathology (6). However, some authors (7) consider the French surgeon Ambrosio Paré, who in 1575 began a real scientific period in France, the father of legal medicine. This paternity is divided with Zacchia, the Pope’s physician, who taught in Italy and wrote in 1601 what can be considered the first medicolegal textbook (7). This was of decisive influence on the development of forensic sciences, as were the European codes of the 16th century (6): the Bamberg Code in 1507 and especially the Caroline Code in 1532, which obliged the courts to call specialized doctors to clarify forensic questions. Nevertheless, the 19th century was indeed a reference for modern legal medicine, born formally in many countries, almost at the same time: 1855 in Austria (6), 1872 in Hungary (8), 1886 in Brazil (7), 1887 in Great Britain (9,10), and 1889 in Portugal (when legal medicine was first referred to as being legally organized [11]). This century was really a golden age for forensic medicine (1,11), which knew a quick but supported growth, especially in France, Italy, and Germany (11). Besides, in German countries, forensic matters were always carefully treated, as can be proved by the early beginning of teaching forensic medicine in some universities in 1720 (11). The posterior development of forensic pathology was processed in accordance with the legal systems and sociopolitical conditions of each country. At the end of the 19th century, complementary sciences, such as toxicology and histology, were aggregate to forensic pathology, and from that union resulted the constitution of legal medicine institutes similar to the medicolegal units known today, where every type of expertise related to justice may be executed.
Later, in the second half of the 20th century, a new medicolegal problem
arose in Europe and wherever roads and cars existed. The traffic accidents
and the necessity of civil litigations of the injuries of the victims led to a new
medicolegal subspecialty concerning living people: clinical forensic medicine. It started in Belgium and France with Derobert, Roche, Muller, and
Rousseau (12). Supported by the Deliberation 75 (7) of the Committee of
Ministers of the Council of Europe, an “expertise-type” was created (12,13)
to achieve a global evaluation of consequences resulting from injuries caused
by accidents to the body of an individual (as a whole being). This process was
crucial for the financial indemnity of the injuries by insurance companies.
These ideas, adopted in Portugal by Oliveira Sá, a great enthusiast of this new
16 Pinheiro
discipline, were developed and “exported” to Spain through the excellent relationship he had with the forensic physicians in the neighbor country, where a
huge development took place; however, it was more as a private medical
activity than centralized in medicolegal institutions. The popularity of this
new forensic area increased quickly because of the growing number of traffic
accidents in the world. Once the Iberian Peninsula was “conquered,” the area
extended to South and Latin America. The English-speaking countries were
the last to develop this new specialty; it has been only within the last several
years that the popularity of clinical forensic medicine has exploded in the
United States and the United Kingdom.

Which doctors are cited as being the fathers of forensic pathology?",The provided document does not contain this information.,"While the document doesn't explicitly name ""fathers of **forensic pathology**"" specifically, it does identify key figures who are considered the fathers of the broader field of **legal medicine** (often used interchangeably with forensic medicine), of which forensic pathology is a prominent branch.

According to the text:

*   The French surgeon **Ambrosio Paré** is considered by some authors to be ""the father of legal medicine"" for initiating a real scientific period in France starting in 1575.
*   This paternity is shared with **Zacchia**, the Pope's physician, who taught in Italy and wrote what is considered the first medicolegal textbook in 1601. This textbook was highly influential in the development of forensic sciences.

It's important to note that forensic pathology is described in the document as ""probably the most emblematic"" branch of forensic medicine, and its definitions are often so broad they could apply to forensic medicine as a whole. Therefore, the foundational work of Paré and Zacchia in legal medicine significantly contributed to the development of forensic pathology as we know it today.

Additionally, **Saliceto**, a surgeon and anatomy teacher at the University of Bologna, began performing forensic dissections in the 13th century, a practice crucial to the eventual development of forensic pathology. Later figures like Rokitansky and Virchow were instrumental in developing hospital autopsies and cellular pathology in the late 19th century, which further advanced pathological understanding relevant to forensic investigations."
"DOCUMENT:
NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks climbed Monday to claw back some of the losses from their worst week in nearly a year and a half.
 

 The S&P 500 rallied 1.2%, though it didn’t recoup all of its drop from Friday, let alone from the rest of the four-day losing streak that it broke. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 484 points, or 1.2%, and the Nasdaq composite gained 1.2%.
 

 Boeing climbed 3.4% after reaching a tentative deal with its largest union on a new contract that, if ratified, will avoid a strike that threatened to shut down aircraft production by the end of the week. Boeing said 33,000 workers represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers would get pay raises of 25% over the four-year contract.
 

 Nvidia and other Big Tech companies also returned to their long-held position of leading the market, at least briefly. Nvidia climbed 3.5% and was the strongest force pushing the S&P 500 upward. That cut into its 13.9% tumble last week, as questions continued about whether its stock price went too high in investors’ frenzy around artificial intelligence, even if Nvidia has continued to top analysts’ expectations for growth.
 

 After likewise climbing a bit in the morning, Treasury yields later pared their gains. That followed sharp swings in the bond market last week, when a highly anticipated update on the U.S. job market came in weak enough to worsen worries about the slowing U.S. economy.
 

 The Federal Reserve has been intentionally pressing the brakes on the economy through high interest rates in order to stifle high inflation. It’s about to start lowering rates later this month, which would ease the pressure on the economy, as it turns its focus toward protecting the job market and avoiding a recession. The question on Wall Street is if the Fed’s shift in focus will prove to be too late.
 

 Cuts to interest rates give stock prices a boost, but if an economic downturn does hit, it could more than offset such a benefit by dragging down profits for companies. That’s what happened in 2007, for example, when the Great Recession wrecked the global economy and financial markets.
 

 “Today, the absence of glaring household or corporate balance sheet vulnerabilities means Fed easing should be enough to prevent recession, and should provide investors some optimism for the future of the market,” suggests Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management.
 

 On Wall Street, Palantir Technologies jumped 14.1% in its first trading after S&P Dow Jones Indices said it would add the company to its widely followed S&P 500 index. Dell Technologies rose 3.8% after likewise getting a notice of promotion to the index, though and Erie Indemnity lost an early gain to slip 0.6%.
 

 Apple’s stock was virutally flat after the company unveiled its latest iPhone model, the 16. It’s the first model to be tailored specifically for artificial intelligence, with expected improvements to its often dim-witted virtual assistant, Siri.
 

 Trading in Big Lots was halted after the discount retailer filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and said it plans to sell its assets and ongoing business operations to private equity firm Nexus Capital Management.
 

 All told, the S&P 500 rose 62.63 points to 5,471.05. The Dow gained 484.18 to 40,829.59, and the Nasdaq composite gained 193.77 to 16,884.60.
 

 In the bond market, the 10-year Treasury yield edged down to 3.71% from 3.72% late Friday.
 

 This upcoming week will feature the latest monthly updates on inflation at the consumer and wholesale levels. Such reports used to be the most anticipated economic data of each month, but market watchers say they’re now taking the back seat to updates on the job market because of the worries about a possible recession.
 

 Of course, if the reports show an unexpected spike higher in inflation, that could put the Federal Reserve in its worst-case scenario. Lower interest rates could help boost the economy, but they could also give inflation more fuel.
 

 In stock markets abroad, indexes rose in much of Europe after falling in Asia. Japan’s Nikkei 225 slipped 0.5% after the country’s economic growth for the second quarter was revised below expectations.
 

 Chinese stocks racked up losses after worse-than-expected inflation data disappointed investors. Indexes fell 1.4% in Hong Kong and 1.1% in Shanghai.

### Relevance of the Federal Reserve to the Economy

The Federal Reserve (often called ""the Fed"") plays an absolutely critical role in the U.S. economy, essentially acting as its central bank. Here's a breakdown of its relevance:

1.  **Monetary Policy and Stability:** The Fed's primary mandate is to foster maximum employment and price stability (i.e., control inflation). It achieves this primarily through adjusting interest rates.
2.  **Current Actions and Goals:**
    *   **Fighting Inflation:** For a period, the Fed has been ""intentionally pressing the brakes on the economy through high interest rates"" to stifle high inflation. High interest rates make borrowing more expensive, which slows down economic activity and theoretically reduces demand, thereby cooling off rising prices.
    *   **Shifting Focus to Growth/Employment:** The document states the Fed is ""about to start lowering rates later this month."" This indicates a shift in focus. Lowering rates eases financial pressure, encourages borrowing and spending, and aims to protect the job market and prevent a recession.
3.  **Impact on Markets and Businesses:**
    *   **Stock Market Boost:** Generally, cuts to interest rates are seen as a positive for stock prices because they reduce borrowing costs for companies, can encourage consumer spending, and make future earnings look more attractive.
    *   **Recession Risk:** However, there's a delicate balance. If the economy is already heading into a downturn, rate cuts might not be enough to prevent a recession. A recession can significantly drag down corporate profits, potentially offsetting any benefit from lower rates, as seen during the Great Recession in 2007.
    *   **Corporate and Household Finances:** Experts like Seema Shah suggest that the current absence of major vulnerabilities in household or corporate balance sheets means that the Fed's easing could be sufficient to prevent a recession, offering some optimism to investors.
4.  **The ""Too Late"" Question:** A major concern on Wall Street is whether the Fed's shift to lowering rates might be ""too late"" to prevent a significant economic downturn. This highlights the difficult challenge the Fed faces in timing its policy changes perfectly.
5.  **Inflation vs. Recession Dilemma:** The Fed operates in a complex environment. While lowering rates can stimulate the economy, it also carries the risk of ""giving inflation more fuel."" This creates a ""worst-case scenario"" if inflation unexpectedly spikes just as the Fed is trying to support growth.
6.  **Economic Data Scrutiny:** Because of these competing concerns, market watchers are now paying even closer attention to job market updates than inflation reports. This reflects the heightened worry about a possible recession and the Fed's balancing act.

In essence, the Federal Reserve is the chief architect of monetary policy, guiding the economy through periods of growth and contraction by managing the cost of money (interest rates). Its decisions profoundly influence everything from stock market performance and corporate profits to job security and the purchasing power of your money."

USER REQUEST:
Who should not get the vaccine, and what other common products should these people be careful of? ","You should not get the vaccine if you have a serious allergy (anaphylaxis) to polyethylene glycol (PEG), which is present in both COVID-19 mRNA vaccines (COVID-19 mRNA vaccines). You should also speak with your health care provider if you had anaphylaxis after a previous dose of a COVID-19 vaccine or if you have had anaphylaxis with an unknown cause (COVID-19 mRNA vaccines).

People who should not get the vaccine due to PEG allergy should be careful of products such as cosmetics, skin care products, laxatives, cough syrups, and bowel preparation products for colonoscopy, as PEG can be found in them (COVID-19 mRNA vaccines). PEG can also be an additive in some processed foods and drinks, though no cases of anaphylaxis to PEG in foods and drinks have been reported (COVID-19 mRNA vaccines).","Based on the document, here's who should not get the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine and what other products they should be careful of:

**Who should not get the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine?**

You should **not** get the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine if you have a **serious allergy (anaphylaxis) to polyethylene glycol (PEG)**. PEG is an ingredient found in both the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccines.

Additionally, it's very important to **speak with your health care provider** if:
* You experienced **anaphylaxis** after a previous dose of a COVID-19 vaccine.
* You have a history of **anaphylaxis with an unknown cause**.

These situations require professional medical advice to determine the safest course of action for your vaccination.

**What other common products should these people be careful of?**

Since polyethylene glycol (PEG) is the key allergen for those who shouldn't get the vaccine, individuals with a serious PEG allergy should be cautious of products that commonly contain it. According to the document, PEG can be found in:

*   **Cosmetics**
*   **Skin care products**
*   **Laxatives**
*   **Cough syrups**
*   **Bowel preparation products for colonoscopy**

The document also notes that PEG can be an additive in some **processed foods and drinks**, though it mentions that no cases of anaphylaxis to PEG in foods and drinks have been reported.

If you have a serious allergy to PEG or any of the other conditions mentioned, it's always best to discuss your concerns with your healthcare provider to ensure your safety with both vaccines and other products. They can provide personalized advice and help you identify potential risks."
"DOCUMENT:
December 24, the day Peterson said he was fishing, was gray, damp, and cold with a bit of wind. Few people were at the Berkeley Marina. When questioned by police, Peterson would not say what he was hoping to catch, but the fishing searches performed from his computer earlier in the month had included searches relating to sturgeon and striped bass. Angelo Cuanang, a published author on fishing in the San Francisco Bay who was accepted by the court as an expert fisherman, testified that Brooks Island was the wrong place to seek sturgeon, which congregated in a different part of the bay that time of year. Sturgeon also preferred live bait to lures, and Peterson’s rod was too weak to catch them. Anchoring was essential to reel in sturgeon; the homemade cement anchor in his boat would have been inadequate. Finally, it was illegal to troll for sturgeon, as Peterson claimed to have done. Peterson’s
lures and the time of year he was fishing were also wrong for catching striped bass. The prosecution’s theory was as follows: Peterson killed Laci sometime on the night of December 23 or morning of December 24. On the morning of the 24th, Peterson let their dog McKenzie out with his leash on to make it appear something had happened while Laci was walking him. He wrapped Laci’s body in a tarp in the bed of his truck, covered her with the patio umbrellas, drove to the warehouse, and then moved her body into his boat.  He drove to the Berkeley Marina, motored out to an area near Brooks Island, and slipped her body, attached to homemade concrete weights like the homemade anchor Peterson had made, into the bay.  Peterson then returned to Modesto, dropped off the boat at the warehouse, put the boat cover out back under a leaky gas blower so that any scent would be obscured, washed his clothes, and proceeded with the ruse that Laci was missing, hoping her body would never be discovered. The defense argued the police had not diligently pursued whether a person or persons other than Peterson were more likely responsible for Laci’s disappearance and murder. The defense presented evidence that a burglary had occurred on the Petersons’ street the week of her disappearance and argued that the police failed adequately to follow up on whether that burglary had any connection to Laci’s disappearance. It also presented evidence that a stranger had gone to several houses on December 23 asking for money and, one neighbor thought, casing houses for burglaries, and so might have had something to do with her disappearance. Testimony was presented thatthe same neighbor, walking with a police officer on Christmas Day to look for the stranger, had seen a pair of sandals lying in the road 150 feet from the Petersons’ home; the neighbor wondered at the time if they might have any connection to Laci’s disappearance, but the officer just left them there. To support the possibility of a third party’s involvement, the defense challenged the prosecution’s theory that Conner died December 23 or 24, presenting its own expert who testified based on ultrasounds and other evidence that Conner lived until after Christmas.The defense also sought to challenge other aspects of the prosecution’s case. To rebut the dog-trailing evidence, the defense called Ronald Seitz, a second dog handler who also had his dog try to find Laci’s scent at the Berkeley Marina on December 28. The dog, T.J., was given Laci’s slipper as a scent object, but discovered no scent trail. To rebut the inference that Peterson had a financial incentive to kill Laci, the defense presented a financial expert who testified that TradeCorp U.S.A. and the Petersons were both reasonably financially healthy. To portray the prosecution’s theory as physically impossible, the defense also sought to introduce video of a demonstration with a weighted 150-pound dummy in a boat on the bay in which a defense firm employee, trying to dump the dummy out, sank the boat. As will be discussed below, the trial court excluded the video. The defense offered explanations for the circumstances of Peterson’s behavior in April. His use of his mother’s name to purchase a car was at her suggestion, to avoid having it impounded. He had large amounts of cash because she gave it to him to reimburse him for money erroneously withdrawn from his bank account rather than hers. Finally, he had his brother’s driver’s license because the club where he was going to golf that day gave discounts for local residents such as his brother. The jury found Peterson guilty of murder in the first degree for killing Laci and murder in the second degree for killing Conner. (See Pen. Code, §§ 187, 189.) It found true the sole charged special circumstance, for multiple murder. Peterson had no criminal record nor any history of violent acts. At the penalty phase, the prosecution relied exclusively on the circumstances of the crime and victim impact evidence. Four members of Laci’s immediate family — her mother, Sharon; her stepfather, Ron Grantski; her brother, Brent; and her sister, Amy — testified. They described who Laci was as a person, shared photographs, memories, and vignettes from her life, and conveyed the grief and loss they each felt after the deaths of Laci and her unborn child. Through friends, family, neighbors, teachers, coworkers, employers, and other witnesses, the defense offered evidence that Peterson had been a kind and positive member of the community. Peterson grew up in a loving family, displayed a patient and gentle disposition, and was a solid student. As part of his high school community service requirement, Peterson worked at a home for the elderly and tutored homeless children. He started his own business and worked a variety of other jobs while in college. According to the defense, Peterson was always calm with Laci. Indeed, witnesses testified Peterson was calm at all times — at work, on the golf course, and in his dealings with all those around him. Friends and family testified to the impact the trial had had on Peterson’s relatives and indicated they believed, if sentenced to life in prison, Peterson could make a positive impact on the lives of others. In closing argument, defense counsel described Peterson’s life as one worth saving and argued that lingering doubt about Peterson’s guilt should also weigh in favor of a life verdict.

What caused the boat to sink?","A defense firm employee, trying to dump a weighted 150-pound dummy out of a boat during a demonstration, sank the boat (Document).","During a demonstration conducted by the defense, a boat sank because a **defense firm employee, while attempting to dump a weighted 150-pound dummy out of the boat into the bay, caused the boat to capsize or become swamped.**

This demonstration was part of the defense's effort to show that the prosecution's theory — that Peterson could have dumped Laci's body into the bay from his boat — was physically impossible. However, the trial court ultimately excluded the video of this demonstration."

Since its emergence in 2019, the worldwide spread of the novel coronavirus
SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) has created a vast economic crisis as government lockdowns
place considerable strain on businesses of all kinds – particularly those that rely on face-
to-face contact, such as retail restaurants, and personal services. Given the importance
of these businesses to local economic development and urban vitality, this paper makes
use of the point-level Chicago Business License dataset to examine the impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic on new business activity in the City of Chicago. The results indicate
that on average, from March to September 2020, total monthly new business starts have
declined by 33.4% compared to the monthly average of new starts in the City from 2016
to 2019. Food service and retail businesses have been hardest hit during this period,
while chains of all types have seen larger average declines in new startup activity than
independent businesses. These patterns also demonstrate interesting intra-urban spatial
heterogeneity; ZIP codes with the largest resilience to pandemic-related drops in new
business activity tend to have more dense, diverse, and walkable built environments, lower
levels of social vulnerability, lower percentages of young residents, and higher percentages
of Black and Asian (non-Hispanic) residents. These findings provide some useful evidence
in support of the “15-minute city” and ethnic enclave resilience hypotheses. Interestingly,
observed COVID-19 case rates also appear to have a positive relationship with new
business resilience for new chain and food service establishments. This is likely due to the
fact that neighborhoods with relatively high levels of new food service business activity
also have relatively higher proportions of food service employees, who are more at risk for
contracting COVID-19 as “essential” workers.
Since the emergence of the novel SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) virus in late 2019, its global
spread has led to a variety of negative economic consequences, from restrictions on business
operations and government lockdowns to reduced consumer confidence, discretionary
mobility, and stock market fluctuations (McKinsey & Company 2020). According to
some estimates, real global Gross Domestic Product (GDP) dropped by 10% between
2019Q4 and 2020Q2 (McKinsey & Company 2020), while US GDP experienced its largest
quarterly drop in history (9.1% in Quarter 2 of 2020), far outstripping the impact of any
previous recessions (measured since data collection began in 1947) (Bauer et al. 2020,
Routley 2020). Concurrently, the US unemployment rate reached its highest-ever recorded
value in April 2020 at 14.7% (FRED 2020), while the S&P 500 lost 33% of its value in
just one month (Capelle-Blancard, Desroziers 2020).
Accordingly, US national data show that small business revenues across all industrial
sectors dropped by 40% in April and had not yet recovered to pre-pandemic (January
2020) levels by August, remaining at a 20% deficit; revenue in “leisure and hospitality”
small businesses, which includes the arts, entertainment, recreation, accommodation,
and food service sectors, have fared even worse, bottoming out at a roughly 70% deficit
and only recovering to around 40% of pre-pandemic levels (Chetty et al. 2020, Bauer
et al. 2020). At the same time, as Figure 1 shows, applications for new businesses “with
planned wages” dropped significantly in 2020Q1 and 2020Q2 compared to recent years,
before significantly rebounding in 2020Q3 and 202Q4 (US Census Bureau 2020). While
this amounts to a higher net number of applications in the first four quarters of 2020
compared to the 2016-2019 average, it is not yet clear whether this is due primarily to an
administrative backlog created by the pandemic, the entrepreneurial activity of the newly
unemployed, or re-adjustments in the market due to increased demand for particular
kinds of goods and services (Bauer et al. 2020).
Further understanding the specific effects of the pandemic on entrepreneurial activity
is particularly important because new business creation is the primary engine for diversity,
economic growth, and innovation in the economy as a whole (Frenken et al. 2007, Neumark
et al. 2006, Wennekers, Thurik 1999), and declines in startup activity can have substantial
negative long-term economic consequences (Sedl´aˇcek 2020, Guorio et al. 2016). There is
also significant spatial heterogeneity in startup activity that plays an important role in
cluster formation, regional economic development, and even the development trajectory
of individual neighbourhoods within regions (Mack, Credit 2016, Malmberg, Maskell 2002,
Florida 2002, Klepper 2009a,b, Porter 2000, Rutten, Boekema 2007). Understanding the
fine-grained spatial and industrial effects of the pandemic on new businesses in more
detail can help researchers and local governments to understand how to develop more
economically resilient regions, which can provide insulation from future economic shocks.
Data on new business applications are available on a weekly basis at the state level from
the US Census Bureau’s Business Formation Statistics (2020). However, other datasets
used to evaluate new business activity at finer spatial scales are not updated quickly
enough to allow researchers to examine the fine-grained spatial and industrial/sectoral
effects of the pandemic on new business activity. These include public datasets like the
ZIP Code Business Patterns, as well as private datasets such as InfoUSA or the National
Establishment Time Series (NETS).
To overcome this problem, this paper utilizes a novel large dataset of business
establishments (at the point level) derived from the open source Chicago Business
License dataset, which is updated weekly and contains a comprehensive set of information
on all new business license applications in the City of Chicago (2020) to assess two
primary questions: first, to what extent has there been a decline in new business
establishment1 starts during the pandemic (March to September, 2020) when compared to
recent pre-pandemic trends (averages from 2016 to 2019)? Specifically, we are interested
in whether there are distinct temporal trends by business sector or type (e.g., retail, food
service, personal care and fitness, etc.) or between multi-establishment (or “chain”) (≥ 4
establishment) businesses and “independent” (< 4 establishment) businesses.
Second, given the temporal analysis, what is the spatial expression of these trends?
Are there particular areas of the city that are more resilient to declines in new business
startups, and, if so, what are the characteristics of these areas? To analyse this formally, we
aggregate changes in pandemic-related (i.e., March to September 2020) business activity
to the ZIP code level in order to explore the relationship between pandemic-related
decline and characteristics of social vulnerability, the built environment, demographics,
and cumulative COVID-19 activity.
The results of the analysis indicate that 1) on average, from March to September
2020 (through which complete data was available at the time of writing), total monthly
new business starts have declined by 33.4% compared to the monthly average of new
starts in the City from January 2016 to December 2019. 2) In general, food service
and retail businesses have been hardest hit during this period (although all categories
have experienced declines), while chains of all types have seen larger average declines
in new startup activity (an average monthly drop of 61.9% from March to September
compared to pre-pandemic averages) than independent businesses (a 29.2% drop). 3) These
patterns demonstrate interesting intra-urban spatial heterogeneity; overall, a regression
analysis suggests that the ZIP codes with the smallest pandemic-related declines in new
business activity (i.e., those most resilient to the effects of the pandemic) tend to have
more dense, diverse, and walkable built environments (defined in more detail below),
lower levels of social vulnerability, lower percentages of young (age 18-39) residents, and
higher percentages of Black and Asian (non-Hispanic) residents. Interestingly, observed
COVID-19 case rates appear to have a positive relationship with new business resilience
(after controlling for a variety of covariates), particularly for new chain and food service
establishments. This could be a case of reverse causality, where areas with relatively high
levels of new food service business activity also have relatively higher proportions of food
service employees, who are more at risk for contracting COVID-19 as “essential” workers.
New business creation provides a number of benefits to both local and macro-level
economies that make it particularly important in the contemporary era of “flexible
specialization” (Harvey 1989, Piore, Sabel 1984). The theoretical pathways from new
business creation to economic benefits are diagrammed in Figure 2. Most directly, new
(generally small) businesses create jobs that contribute to local economic growth (Birch
1987, Kirchhoff, Phillips 1988, Neumark et al. 2006). While on net these jobs may not
always exceed the number of jobs lost from the older businesses they replace (Mack, Credit
2017), this process of business “churn” increases the probability of creating high-growth
firms (so-called “gazelles”) that tend to produce the majority of new jobs (Henrekson,
Johansson 2010, Nightingale, Coad 2014) and also provides for the “creative destruction”
that fosters evolution and innovation in the economy2 by replacing jobs and businesses in
older declining industries with new jobs in more innovative industries (Schumpeter 1934,
1947, 1950, Brown et al. 2006, Fogel et al. 2008).
Another way that entrepreneurship fosters innovation and productivity improvement
is through the creation of a more competitive economic environment that produces a
selection process through which only the most viable and/or innovative businesses survive
(Wennekers, Thurik 1999, Carree, Thurik 2003). Interestingly, this more competitive
environment can drive a positive feedback loop through which increased competitiveness
drives demand for better products, which creates incentives for additional innovation
and new business creation (Teece 2007, Asheim 1996, Florida 1995, Porter 2000, Rutten,
Boekema 2007, Malmberg, Maskell 2002). Fully fledged clusters, such as Silicon Valley,
can develop a unique entrepreneurial culture of “competition and community” (Saxenian
1994) and attract additional educational, political, and financial investments that foster a
holistic “entrepreneurial ecosystem” (Mack, Mayer 2015, Stam 2015) that captures the
indigenous benefits of innovation, leading to economic success for individual businesses
and associated local economic benefits, as well as providing a more supportive environment
for further new business creation (Delgado et al. 2010). New businesses also contribute to
innovation because they are often created as a direct result of knowledge spillovers, i.e., a
new business is formed specifically to take advantage of some newly generated knowledge
or idea (Acs, Audretsch 2003, Acs et al. 2009). These are often in the form of spinoffs
from large existing companies, which some argue constitute the bulk of cluster forming
activity (Buenstorf, Klepper 2009, Klepper, Sleeper 2005, Klepper 2009a,b).
Finally, new businesses directly contribute to economic diversity. Increased diversity
within related industries (i.e., “related variety”) provides another engine for innovation as
the pool of new ideas and possible interactions and exchanges increases with the diversity
of firms (Jacobs 1967, Boschma, Lambooy 1999, Boschma, Frenken 2006, Saviotti, Pyka
2004, Frenken et al. 2007). On the other hand, diversity through “unrelated variety”
provides important portfolio benefits to local economies by distributing economic risk
across a variety of different industries, making the economic system more resilient to
unexpected shocks that may occur, no matter what sector they are concentrated in
(Montgomery 1994, Frenken et al. 2007).
In this paper, we are particularly interested in new business creation for small,
independently owned businesses in customer-facing sectors such as retail and food service,
for several reasons. These businesses are significant contributors to land use diversity,
street life, and overall urban vitality (Jacobs 1961, Gehl 2010). At the same time, small
retail shops help to contribute to a unique “sense of place” in a given locality that is
the direct product of local creative efforts and sensibilities (Jacobs 1961, Relph 1976,
Robertson 1999, Kunstler 1994, Walljasper 2007, Alexander 1977, Montgomery 1998).
The owners of these kinds of businesses themselves are also often more connected to the
specific dynamics, demands, and politics of the local community, and tend to contribute
to local import substitution (increasing the local multiplier effect) by spending profits
to purchase requisite subsidiary goods and services locally, rather than exporting profits
to another region, as is the case with larger chain businesses (Jacobs 1967, Talen, Jeong
2019a,b).

What resilience factors led to the smallest declines in new business activity during the COVID-19 pandemic?","ZIP codes that showed the smallest pandemic-related declines in new business activity, indicating resilience, tended to have more dense, diverse, and walkable built environments, lower levels of social vulnerability, lower percentages of young residents, and higher percentages of Black and Asian (non-Hispanic) residents (Page 1, Page 4). Observed COVID-19 case rates also appeared to have a positive relationship with new business resilience, particularly for new chain and food service establishments (Page 1, Page 4).","During the COVID-19 pandemic, certain factors contributed to greater resilience and thus smaller declines in new business activity in Chicago ZIP codes. The study found that areas exhibiting the most resilience tended to have:

*   **Dense, Diverse, and Walkable Built Environments:** Neighborhoods with these characteristics seemed better equipped to handle the economic strain on new businesses. This aligns with the ""15-minute city"" hypothesis, suggesting that areas where amenities are easily accessible by walking and where there's a mix of uses foster more robust local economies.
*   **Lower Levels of Social Vulnerability:** Communities that were less socially vulnerable experienced fewer drops in new business startups. Social vulnerability often relates to factors like poverty, lack of access to resources, and health disparities, which can exacerbate economic shocks.
*   **Demographic Characteristics:**
    *   **Lower Percentages of Young Residents (age 18-39):** ZIP codes with fewer residents in this age bracket showed more resilience.
    *   **Higher Percentages of Black and Asian (non-Hispanic) Residents:** These communities demonstrated stronger resilience to pandemic-related declines in new business activity, supporting the ""ethnic enclave resilience"" hypothesis.
*   **Observed COVID-19 Case Rates (with a nuance):** Interestingly, the study observed a positive relationship between higher COVID-19 case rates and new business resilience, particularly for new chain and food service establishments. The researchers suggest this might be due to reverse causality: areas with more food service activity have a higher proportion of ""essential"" food service employees, who are more exposed to the virus, thereby leading to higher case rates in areas that are still seeing business activity.

In essence, neighborhoods that were well-structured, less vulnerable, and had specific demographic profiles were better able to withstand the economic challenges posed by the pandemic, allowing new businesses to emerge or continue operations with fewer setbacks."
"DOCUMENT:
“Ray tracing is the future, and it always will be!” has been the tongue-in-cheek phrase used by graphics developers for decades when asked whether real-time ray tracing will ever be feasible.
 

 Everyone seems to agree on the first part: ray tracing is the future. That’s because ray tracing is the only technology we know of that enables the rendering of truly photorealistic images. It’s no coincidence that every offline renderer used in the movie industry, where compromises on image quality are unacceptable, is based on ray tracing. Rasterization has made immense strides over the years, and it is still evolving even today. But it is also fundamentally limited in the type of effects it can compute. Truly taking graphics to the next level requires new underlying technology. This is where ray tracing comes in, and this is why real-time ray tracing has long been the dream of gamers and game developers.
 

 So will ray tracing always remain a dream of the future, and never arrive in the present? At GDC 2018, NVIDIA unveiled RTX, a high-performance implementation that will power all ray tracing APIs supported by NVIDIA on Volta and future GPUs. At the same event, Microsoft announced the integration of ray tracing as a first-class citizen into their industry standard DirectX API.
 

 Putting these two technologies together forms such a powerful combination that we can confidently answer the above question: the future is here! This is not a hyperbole: leading game studios are developing upcoming titles using RTX through DirectX — today. Ray tracing in games is no longer a pipe dream. It’s happening, and it will usher in a new era of real-time graphics.
 

 he API that Microsoft announced, DirectX Raytracing (DXR), is a natural extension of DirectX 12. It fully integrates ray tracing into DirectX, and makes it a companion (as opposed to a replacement) to rasterization and compute.
 

 API Overview
 The DXR API focuses on delivering high performance by giving the application signficant low-level control, as with earlier versions of DirectX 12. Several design decisions reflect this:
 

 All ray tracing related GPU work is dispatched via command lists and queues that the application schedules. Ray tracing therefore integrates tightly with other work such as rasterization or compute, and can be enqueued efficiently by a multithreaded application.
 Ray tracing shaders are dispatched as grids of work items, similar to compute shaders. This lets the implementation utilize the massive parallel processing throughput of GPUs and perform low-level scheduling of work items as appropriate for the given hardware.
 The application retains the responsibility of explicitly synchronizing GPU work and resources where necessary, as it does with rasterization and compute. This allows developers to optimize for the maximum amount of overlap between ray tracing, rasterization, compute work, and memory transfers.
 Ray tracing and other dispatch types share all resources such as textures, buffers, and constants. No conversion, duplication, or mapping is required to access a resource from ray tracing shaders.
 Resources that hold ray tracing specific data, such as acceleration structures and shader tables (see below), are entirely managed by the application. No memory allocations or transfers happen implicitly “under the hood”.
 Shader compilation is explicit and therefore under full application control. Shaders can be compiled individually or in batch. Compilation can be parallelized across multiple CPU threads if desired.
 At a high level, DXR introduces three new concepts to DirectX that the application must manage:
 

 Ray Tracing Pipeline State Objects contain the compiled shader code that gets executed during a ray tracing dispatch.
 Acceleration Structures contain the data structures used to accelerate ray tracing itself, i.e. the search for intersections between rays and scene geometry.
 Shader Tables define the relationship between ray tracing shaders, their resources (textures, constants, etc), and scene geometry.
 Let’s take a closer look at these.
 

 The traditional raster graphics pipeline defines a number of shader types: vertex shader, geometry shader, pixel shader, etc. Analog to that model, a ray tracing pipeline consists of five new shader types which are executed at different stages:
 

 The ray generation shader is the first thing invoked in a ray tracing dispatch. Ray generation shaders are comparable to compute shaders, with the added capability of calling the new HLSL function TraceRay(). This function casts a single ray into the scene to search for intersections, triggering other shaders in the process. A ray generation shader may call TraceRay() as many times as it likes.
 Intersection and any hit shaders are invoked whenever TraceRay() finds a potential intersection between the ray and the scene. The intersection shader determines whether the ray intersects an individual geometric primitive — for example a sphere, a subdivision surface, or really any primitive type you can code up! The most common type is, of course, triangles, for which the API offers special support through a built-in, highly tuned intersection shader. Once an intersection is found, the any hit shader may be used to process it further or potentially discard it. Any hit shaders commonly implement alpha testing by performing a texture lookup and deciding based on the texel’s value whether or not to discard an intersection.
 Once TraceRay() has completed the search for ray-scene intersections, either a closest hit or a miss shader is invoked, depending on the outcome of the search. The closest hit shader is typically where most shading operations take place: material evaluation, texture lookups, and so on. The miss shader can be used to implement environment lookups, for example. Both closest hit and miss shaders can recursively trace rays by calling TraceRay() themselves.
 

 The pipeline constructed from these shaders defines a single-ray programming model. Semantically, each GPU thread handles one ray at a time and cannot communicate with other threads or see other rays currently being processed. This keeps things simple for developers writing shaders, while allowing room for vendor-specific optimizations under the hood of the API.
 

 The main way for the different shader types to communicate with each other is the ray payload. The payload is simply a user-defined struct that’s passed as an inout parameter to TraceRay(). Any hit, closest hit, and miss shaders can read and write the payload, and therefore pass back the result of their computations to the caller of TraceRay().

I see that on the new flagship Nvidia models, there is always the designation RTX. What does this mean and why is it important? Explain in under 300 words.","At GDC 2018, NVIDIA unveiled RTX, which is described as a high-performance implementation. This RTX implementation is designed to power all ray tracing APIs supported by NVIDIA on their Volta and future GPUs [1].

RTX is important because it, in combination with Microsoft's integration of ray tracing into their DirectX API, forms a powerful combination that signifies the arrival of ray tracing in the present [1]. Leading game studios are currently developing upcoming titles using RTX through DirectX [1]. The document states that ray tracing in games is no longer a pipe dream, but is happening and ""will usher in a new era of real-time graphics"" [1].","The ""RTX"" designation on NVIDIA's flagship models stands for **Ray Tracing eXtreme** (or simply Ray Tracing). It signifies that these GPUs are equipped with specialized hardware and software to perform real-time ray tracing, a revolutionary graphics rendering technique.

Here's why it's so important:

1.  **Photorealism:** Ray tracing is the only technology known to enable truly photorealistic images. Unlike traditional rasterization, which approximates light, ray tracing simulates how light behaves in the real world, leading to incredibly accurate reflections, shadows, and global illumination. This is why it's been standard in the movie industry for years.
2.  **A Dream Realized:** For decades, real-time ray tracing in games was considered a distant dream. NVIDIA's RTX, unveiled in 2018 alongside Microsoft's DirectX Raytracing (DXR) API, made this dream a reality.
3.  **New Era of Graphics:** The combination of RTX hardware and DXR software means that game developers can now integrate these advanced lighting effects directly into their titles. This ushers in a new era of graphics, bringing movie-quality visuals and unprecedented realism to interactive gaming experiences.

In short, RTX means your graphics card can render games with stunning, lifelike visuals that were previously impossible in real-time."

There are two common types of materials that are used in the field of prosthetics and orthotics; these materials are thermoplastics and carbon fiber. Each of these types of materials have different uses and applications and are used based on the needs of each patient and the type of device they are receiving.
 Carbon is among one of the most valuable materials used in orthopedic applications. Carbon is very light, rigid, and able to hold its shape under stress. This is due to its high tensile strength under both tension and compression. Carbon has a bi-directional woven pattern that allows for an increase in the fracture resistance, allowing for a uniform strength throughout the device (Berry). This means that the carbon socket (prosthetics) or the brace (orthotics) is very durable and can withstand a lot of pressure from patient use.
 Carbon fiber is used in prosthetics for the definitive socket that the patient will receive after the test socket has been approved by the patient. The design of the socket is determined by the type of prosthesis that the patient is receiving and the patient and customize the outer design of the socket to their liking. In orthotics, carbon fiber is used based on the type of brace and activity level of the patient. Carbon fiber allows for increased rigidity in the brace which is needed for braces that allow for an articulating ankle or for braces that need increased stability.
 The use of thermoplastics delivers many design improvements over carbon and other traditional systems due to design options that allow increased contact and support on the limb, simple fabrication process, a reduction in weight with retained strength, and cosmetic improvements allowing for a variety of options for color and decorative transfer patterns (Thermoplastics). Although thermoplastics are not as rigid as carbon fiber, they still offer man benefits for the patient and are a great option for patient use.
 There are different types of plastics used in prosthetics and orthotics. For prosthetics, thermoplastics are used for diagnostic or test sockets for the patients when they are working out the fit of the socket before they are transferred to a carbon fiber socket. The thermoplastics used are Thermolyn also know and Orffitrans; commonly used for below the knee sockets, and Vivak also known as DurrPlex; commonly used in above the knee sockets.
 There are 2 common thermoplastics used in orthotics; Copolymer and Polypropylene. Polypropylene, also known as Polypro, has high elasticity and stiffness and is good for producing very thin-walled, lightweight, and stable orthotic devices, although can be brittle and easily broken. Copolymer, also known and Copoly, has a high impact strength and is easily formed with low temperatures, which makes it easily adjustable to suit the patient’s needs (Smit).
 These materials allow for the best possible device to be created for the patient, different strengths, rigidity and weights allow for a variety of options to create the best possible custom device based on the patient’s activity level and use of the device.

Explain the differences and advantages between carbon fiber and thermoplastics in prosthetic design. Which material would be better for designing leg limbs for individuals who like to participate in sports?","In prosthetic design, carbon fiber and thermoplastics have distinct uses and characteristics.

**Differences and Advantages:**

*   **Purpose:** Thermoplastics are used for diagnostic or test sockets to determine the fit before a patient transitions to a carbon fiber socket (Thermoplastics). Carbon fiber is used for the definitive socket once the test socket has been approved (Berry).
*   **Rigidity:** Carbon fiber is described as very rigid (Berry), while thermoplastics are noted as not being as rigid as carbon fiber (Thermoplastics).
*   **Strength and Durability:** Carbon is able to hold its shape under stress due to high tensile strength under both tension and compression, and its bi-directional woven pattern increases fracture resistance, providing uniform strength throughout the device, making carbon sockets very durable and able to withstand significant pressure from patient use (Berry). Thermoplastics offer a reduction in weight with retained strength (Thermoplastics).
*   **Fabrication and Aesthetics:** Thermoplastics deliver design improvements over carbon and other systems through design options for increased contact and support, a simple fabrication process, and cosmetic improvements allowing for color and decorative transfer patterns (Thermoplastics). Carbon fiber's design is determined by the type of prosthesis, and patients can customize the outer design (Berry).
*   **Weight:** Carbon is among the most valuable materials, noted for being very light (Berry). Thermoplastics also offer a reduction in weight (Thermoplastics).

**Material for Sports Participants:**

For designing leg limbs for individuals who like to participate in sports, carbon fiber would be better. Carbon is described as very light, rigid, and able to hold its shape under stress due to high tensile strength (Berry). Its bi-directional woven pattern increases fracture resistance, providing uniform strength, which makes the carbon socket very durable and able to withstand a lot of pressure from patient use (Berry). These characteristics suggest it is more suitable for high-activity use compared to thermoplastics, which are noted as not being as rigid (Thermoplastics).","That's a fantastic question, as the choice of material in prosthetics makes a huge difference in a patient's comfort, functionality, and overall quality of life!

Let's break down the differences and advantages between carbon fiber and thermoplastics, and then talk about which might be better for an athlete.

### Carbon Fiber in Prosthetic Design

**What it is:** Carbon fiber is a highly advanced material known for its incredible strength-to-weight ratio. It's often woven into a bi-directional pattern for even greater resilience.

**Advantages:**

*   **Exceptional Durability and Strength:** Carbon fiber is incredibly robust, able to hold its shape under significant stress, tension, and compression. It's designed to withstand a lot of pressure from daily use, making the prosthetic device very durable.
*   **Rigidity and Stability:** It provides superior rigidity, which is crucial for the stability of a prosthetic limb. This allows for excellent force transfer and control, especially during demanding activities. Its woven pattern increases fracture resistance, ensuring uniform strength.
*   **Lightweight:** Despite its strength, carbon fiber is very light, which is a major benefit for patients as it reduces fatigue and improves maneuverability.
*   **Long-Term Solution:** Carbon fiber is typically used for the ""definitive socket""—the permanent, custom-made part of the prosthesis that the patient wears long-term after the initial fitting process.

### Thermoplastics in Prosthetic Design

**What it is:** Thermoplastics are a family of plastics that become pliable when heated and solidify when cooled. Common types used in prosthetics include Thermolyn (Orffitrans) and Vivak (DurrPlex).

**Advantages:**

*   **Design Flexibility and Comfort:** Thermoplastics allow for increased contact and support on the residual limb. Their ability to be easily molded when warm makes for simple fabrication and excellent customization, ensuring a snug, comfortable fit.
*   **Weight Reduction:** They offer a reduction in weight while still retaining good strength, contributing to a lighter overall device.
*   **Cosmetic Options:** Thermoplastics provide more cosmetic improvements, offering a variety of colors and decorative transfer patterns, allowing patients to personalize the look of their prosthesis.
*   **Ease of Adjustment:** Because they can be reheated and reshaped, thermoplastics are easier to adjust, making them ideal for the initial fitting stages.
*   **Diagnostic Tool:** They are primarily used for ""diagnostic"" or ""test sockets."" This means they're used in the crucial phase where the clinical team and patient are working out the perfect fit before committing to a more permanent carbon fiber socket. For instance, Thermolyn is often used for below-knee test sockets, and Vivak for above-knee test sockets.

### Which Material for Sports Enthusiasts?

When it comes to designing leg limbs for individuals who love to participate in sports, **carbon fiber** would be the superior choice for the definitive socket.

Here's why:

1.  **Unmatched Strength and Durability:** Sports activities, especially high-impact ones, place immense stress on prosthetic limbs. Carbon fiber's exceptional strength, high tensile resistance, and fracture resistance mean it can withstand the rigors of running, jumping, pivoting, and other athletic movements without deforming or breaking down.
2.  **Superior Rigidity for Performance:** The rigidity of carbon fiber is crucial for stability and efficient energy transfer. Athletes need a limb that provides a firm platform for pushing off, absorbing impact, and maintaining balance. This rigidity allows for more powerful and precise movements, directly contributing to athletic performance.
3.  **Long-Term Reliability:** For an athlete, consistency and reliability in their equipment are paramount. Carbon fiber's durability ensures that the prosthetic limb will perform consistently over many training sessions and competitions.

While thermoplastics are excellent for the initial fitting process due to their adjustability and comfort, their lower rigidity compared to carbon fiber makes them less suitable for the sustained high-stress environment of sports. The definitive socket for an active individual would almost certainly be crafted from carbon fiber to provide the necessary strength, stability, and durability for peak athletic performance."

Outer space has come a long way since the 1960s. Matthew Weinzierl explains the current state of the space economy, highlighting the various opportunities for businesses hidden among the stars.
 A new space race—one fueled more by commercial conquest than intergalactic domination—is charting solutions to pressing problems in national security, climate change, and communication.
 

 With costs poised to drop and innovation on the rise, the economics of cosmic exploration and commerce are rapidly changing. Harvard Business School Senior Associate Dean Matthew Weinzierl’s new research explores the business opportunities hidden among the stars, particularly in data from and through space, but also in tourism, manufacturing, and even space-based resources.
 

 “From national security to climate change observation and trying to fix some of the biggest problems on Earth, the space economy is now interwoven in our everyday lives,” says Weinzierl, who is also the Joseph and Jacqueline Elbling Professor of Business Administration.
 

 Baskin: What are the highest-growth areas in the space economy?
 

 Weinzierl: What’s really interesting about what’s happening in space is the fundamental transformation of how it’s being organized. For a long time, when most people thought about what we do in space as humans, they thought of it as primarily a government-led activity. They thought of the James Webb telescope, the International Space Station, or the space shuttle.
 

 “If you look at the area of space getting the most attention―manufacturing of launch vehicles and satellites―its growth is in fact quite strong.”
 What’s changed over the past couple decades is that the government-led model, which served us extremely well back in the 1960s, has been revolutionized by bringing in market forces in a way that they never were before. Competition that we take for granted in most sectors of the economy is now driving efficiencies and innovations in the space sector, making it much more of a typical industry, or at least a typical industry with a tremendous amount of technological growth in it.
 

 What we found in our recent paper (which I coauthored with Tina Highfill of the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis) is that growth in the space sector overall has been quite modest over the past decade or so, but if you look at the area of space getting the most attention―manufacturing of launch vehicles and satellites―its growth is in fact quite strong. That’s especially true when you adjust for the quality improvements and price declines in that area; something our research is the first to quantify. In other words, we can see the dynamism of the space sector in the data.
 

 Baskin: What was the inflection point for this growth?
 

 Weinzierl: The key point is the early 2000s. The second of two shuttle losses, in 2003, meant that the last space shuttle flight was in 2011. This was a serious crisis for the American space community, given that, 40 years earlier, we put people on the moon. There was this sense that: “Wait a minute, I thought we were going to have space hotels and moon bases.” Instead, the United States was going to have to buy trips for our astronauts to the Space Station from Russia. This caused real soul-searching in the sector.
 

 It’s also when NASA started investing in the commercial space sector in a more concerted way. It created a program called Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS). It spent $500 million to start seeding rocket launch companies to provide a new way to get back to the Space Station, which included companies like Blue Origin, SpaceX, and Sierra. A couple of decades later, SpaceX, in particular, has absolutely revolutionized the costs of launching rockets and thus doing anything in space.
 

 Baskin: How might the space economy affect the future of investing?
 

 Weinzierl: Space investing is a tricky sector.
 

 There was a big boom, a few years ago, in these private space enterprises trying to go public through special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs). In a SPAC, somebody would start a company with the sole idea of acquiring a private company and taking it public—and people who had signed up to invest in the original company could decide whether or not to stick with it.
 

 “Space is one of these industries where typical venture capital models struggle with the deep levels of uncertainty and the longer time frames that it requires.”
 The trouble is that, partly because SPACs are a bit opaque, they lend themselves to the risk of hype behind their projections. Most space SPACs crashed in value as soon as they went public, so many investors got a real sense that space is a dangerous place to invest.
 

 But, when you talk to people who are sophisticated space investors, they say, “Sure, that was a bit of a crazy cycle.” But it’s also a bit of an understandable cycle. Space is one of these industries where typical venture capital models struggle with the deep levels of uncertainty and the longer time frames that it requires. But, if you’re a sophisticated space investor with a solid theory for how to understand the pitches you’re hearing, there are still great ideas and companies out there. The sector has been quite resilient, in many ways.
 

 Baskin: How will the space economy affect the future of work?
 

 Weinzierl: In the next five to 10 years, the vast majority of economic activity directly tied to space, which would affect your typical worker, is going to be based on satellites, namely using data from them about the Earth and data through them as satellite internet expands its reach. If we look out a bit further, you get more speculative but exciting ideas like space manufacturing, tourism, and potentially resource extraction from places like the moon and asteroids.
 

 In many ways, those ideas seem very sci-fi. But technology is well-developed for several of them, and it’s more about finding the right business cases. The sector is looking feverishly for them, and, as costs keep coming down, I’m relatively optimistic that more of what seems like sci-fi will become reality over the next couple of decades.
 

 If you think about data as being the backbone of the modern economy, and the transmission of information increasingly defining what so many industries are, space is very much at the center of that over the next five to 10 years. I think the clearest way to see that is through the SpaceX Starlink constellation, which is already a constellation of several thousand satellites. Many thousands more are planned to provide high-speed Internet through satellites around the world. Amazon is planning a similar constellation of satellites, as is China.
 

 Of course, the initial application of that is just providing Internet coverage to places where it’s hard to run fiber-optic cables. But, if you think about the Internet of Things, and the connectivity that everyone is planning to have between every device in every place on Earth, which will enable all sorts of functionality—especially in terms of mobile processing or mobile devices—the existence of this Internet transformation really could redefine sectors quite broadly in a way we can’t foresee. That’s the real magic of markets, after all.

What projects has NASA invested in the space economy? Where can the regular person invest in the space economy? Summarize in 500 words or less.","NASA invested in the commercial space sector, creating a program called Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) (Weinzierl). Through COTS, NASA spent $500 million to seed rocket launch companies, including Blue Origin, SpaceX, and Sierra, to develop new ways to transport items to the Space Station (Weinzierl).

Regarding where a regular person can invest in the space economy, the provided document does not contain this information. It discusses space investing as a ""tricky sector"" (Weinzierl). The document mentions a past boom where private space enterprises went public through special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), but most of these space SPACs ""crashed in value as soon as they went public,"" leading many investors to perceive space as ""a dangerous place to invest"" (Weinzierl). The text indicates that ""sophisticated space investors"" may still find opportunities, but it does not provide guidance for a ""regular person"" on specific investment avenues (Weinzierl).","The space economy has evolved significantly, moving from being primarily government-led to embracing commercial innovation. Here's a look at NASA's investments and how a regular person might navigate investing in this exciting, yet challenging, sector.

**NASA's Investments in the Space Economy**

NASA has played a pivotal role in fostering the commercial space sector, especially after the unfortunate space shuttle losses in the early 2000s. This period prompted a strategic shift, recognizing the need to integrate market forces into space activities.

Specifically, NASA established the **Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program**. Through COTS, NASA invested approximately **$500 million** with the explicit goal of ""seeding rocket launch companies."" The objective was to cultivate new commercial capabilities for delivering cargo and eventually crew to the International Space Station, reducing reliance on government-operated systems. This initiative was instrumental in supporting the early development of now prominent companies such as **Blue Origin, SpaceX, and Sierra**. These strategic investments were crucial in bringing about market competition, driving down launch costs, and spurring the rapid innovation we see in the space sector today.

**Where a Regular Person Can Invest in the Space Economy**

For the ""regular person,"" investing in the space economy is described as a ""tricky sector"" due to its inherent uncertainties and longer timeframes compared to other industries. The document highlights some important considerations:

1.  **Direct Investment in New Ventures (High Risk):** A few years ago, there was a notable boom in private space enterprises attempting to go public through **Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPACs)**. However, most of these ""crashed in value as soon as they went public."" This experience led many investors to perceive space as a ""dangerous place to invest"" directly in new, pure-play companies. While sophisticated investors might still find opportunities, this avenue carries significant volatility and is generally not recommended for the average individual without deep expertise and a high-risk tolerance.

2.  **Established Companies:** A potentially more stable approach for a regular person is to invest in larger, more established aerospace and defense companies that have significant divisions or investments in space technologies and services. These companies often have diversified revenue streams and more mature business models, which can offer a degree of stability compared to startups.

3.  **Space-Focused ETFs or Mutual Funds:** While not explicitly mentioned in the document, a common strategy for regular investors to gain diversified exposure to a sector like space is through **Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)** or mutual funds that specialize in the space, aerospace, or technology innovation sectors. These funds hold a basket of companies involved in the space economy, which can help mitigate the risk of investing in a single volatile stock.

4.  **Indirect Participation through Consumption:** The document emphasizes that in the next 5-10 years, much of the economic activity tied to space will directly impact consumers through satellites, providing data and expanding satellite internet services (like SpaceX's Starlink or Amazon's planned constellation). While not a financial investment, utilizing these services means participating in and supporting the growth of the space economy.

In summary, while the space economy is experiencing rapid innovation and holds immense future potential, direct investment in new space ventures can be highly speculative for the average individual. A more prudent approach might involve diversified investments through established companies or specialized funds, coupled with a cautious, long-term perspective."

Liu et al.,(2005) showed that the theaflavin derivatives had more potent anti-HIV-1 activity than catechin derivatives. These tea polyphenols could inhibit HIV-1 entry into target cells by blocking HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein-mediated membrane fusion. The fusion inhibitory activity of the tea polyphenols was correlated with their ability to block the formation of the gp41 six- helix bundle, a fusion-active core conformation. Computer-aided molecular docking analyses indicate that these tea polyphenols, theaflavin-3,3′-digallate (TF3) as an example, may bind to the highly conserved hydrophobic pocket on the surface of the central trimeric coiled coil formed by the N-terminal heptad repeats of gp41. These results indicate that tea, especially black tea, may be used as a source of anti-HIV agents and theaflavin derivatives may be applied as lead compounds for developing HIV-1 entry inhibitors targeting gp41.
EGCG present in green tea has been shown to inhibit Herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) (Oleviera, 2008; Issack et al., 2008) by possibly binding to the glycoproteins on the envelope of the virus, thereby preventing viral entry into the host cell. The increased stability of theaflavins compared to EGCG at neutral pH could make these black tea compounds a more feasible option for the design of an antiviral therapeutic agent than EGCG (Su et al, 2003).

consisting primarily of theaflavins is not cytotoxic and can reduce or block the production of infectious HSV-1 virions in cultured A549 and Vero cells, thus inhibiting the infectivity of the virus by interfering in the attachment, penetration and viral DNA replication of HSV-1 particles (Cantatore et al.,2013).
The anti-influenza virus and anti-inflammatory activities of theaflavin derivatives have been reported by Zu at. el.,(2012). The theaflavins fraction (TF80%, with a purity of 80%) and three theaflavin (TF) derivatives from black tea have been found to exhibit potent inhibitory effects against influenza virus in vitro. The authors have used assays for neuraminidase (NA) activity, hemagglutination (HA) inhibition, a real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) for gene expression of hemagglutinin (HA) and a cytopathic effect (CPE) reduction assay for studying the activity of TFs. The results showed that the TFs exerted significant inhibitory effects on the NA of three different subtypes of influenza virus strains and also on HA through two major mechanisms. The TF derivatives might have a direct effect on viral particle infectivity affecting replication of the viral HA gene during early stage of infection. In addition, TFs decreased the expression level of the inflammatory cytokine IL-6 during viral infection, expression of which may result in serious tissue injury and apoptosis. Thus, the results indicated that TF derivatives are potential compounds with anti-influenza viral replication and anti-inflammatory properties.
A study of antiviral activity of theaflavins (extracted from black tea) against Hepatitis C virus (HCV) using human hepatoma Huh-7 cells showed significant decrease of infectivity of the virus in the presence of each of the three theaflavins, with a clear dose-dependent inhibitory effect. The antiviral activity of the theaflavins was confirmed by quantification of viral RNA. TF3 was found to be more active and the HCV pseudotyped virions confirmed their activity on HCV entry and demonstrated their pan-genotypic action by directly acting on the virus particle and inhibited cell-to-cell spread. Further, TFs in combination with Sofosbuvir and Daclatasvir which are FDA approved drugs for HCV, enhanced the antiviral activity of both drugs (additive effect) demonstrating that it could be used in combination with direct acting antivirals (DAA) used in hepatitis C therapy. Thus, theaflavins, that are present in high quantity in black tea, hold promise for therapeutic use against HCV infection and also as neutraceutical as it inhibit cell-to-cell entry of the virus (Chowdhury, et al., 2018).
In a study reported by Clark et al. (1998) it was demonstrated that theaflavins extracted from black tea were able to neutralize bovine coronavirus and rotavirus infections. The crude black tea extract and the various fractions of theaflavins extracted from black tea were tested individually and in combination for antirotaviral activity. The combination of theaflavin fractions (TF1 + TF2a + TF2b + TF3) was more active than the sum of the activities of these four fractions individually, indicating synergism amongst the TF components. The results of this study showed that theaflavin and theaflavin gallate derivatives have inactivation activity (in vitro) against both rotavirus and coronavirus. The crude black tea extract was also able to neutralize the coronavirus.
In view of the current pandemic created by the novel corona virus COVID-19, lot of efforts are on globally to develop suitable vaccine and to relook the existing drugs and molecules for effectiveness against the causative agent SARS-CoV-2 (Tang et al., 2020). Coronaviruses are enveloped positive-stranded RNA viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm (Belouzard et al. 2012). To deliver their nucleocapsid into the host cell they rely on the fusion of their envelope with the host cell membrane. The spike glycoprotein (S) mediates virus entry and is a primary determinant of cell tropism and pathogenesis. The RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is known to be an important enzyme that catalyzes the replication of RNA from RNA templates.

In a recent study published in the Journal of Medical Virology, 83 compounds used in Chinese medicine system were screened for their potential efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 by assessing their binding efficiency onto this RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of the COVID-19 virus (Lung et. al., 2020). The authors have generated three dimensional model structures of RdRp of SARS-CoV-2 (2019 Pandemic), SARS-CoV (2002 epidemic) and MERS-CoV (2012 epidemic) using Modeller UCSF Chimera (https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/) and SWISS-MODEL (https:// swissmodel. expasy.org/) to test the efficacy of the compounds. This virtual screening in this bioinformatics study revealed that out of the 83 compounds screened, theaflavin was the best compound on the basis of idock score (prediction of binding affinity), hydrophobic interactions and additional hydrogen bonds between theaflavin and amino acid near the active site of RdRp. This was further confirmed by lower binding energy when it docks the catalytic pocket of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. These finding suggested that theaflavins could be used as a lead compound for developing a SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor that targets the RdRp. Theaflavins are present in black tea and the highest theaflavin contents are present in the black teas of Assam.
Though further in vivo, animal and clinical trials would be required to carry forward this research finding, it is quite interesting to note that an earlier study from Taiwan has in fact convincingly demonstrated the inhibition of SARS-CoV 3C-like protease activity by Theaflavin-3,3’-digallate (TF3) published in the journal Evidence based Complementary and Alternative Medicine (Chen et.al.,2005). The authors have reported that the extracts from Puer and Black tea were more potent than the green or oolong tea extracts in their inhibitory activities against a chymotrypsin-like (3CLPro) protease. In this study 3CL protease was a target and the virus of interest was SARS- CoV (2002 epidemic). This study also used docking approach to screen out the best inhibitory compounds using a natural product library consisting of 720 compounds. Two compounds, tannic acid and TF2b (Theaflavin 3-gallate) were found to be active against 3CL Protease. Since many other related to tannic acid and TF2b are also present in various kinds of teas, the authors further examined the inhibition of activity by various tea extracts and several well known pure ingredients present in teas. The water extracts of TF2b (theaflavin-3-gallate), TF3 (theaflavin diggallate) and tannic acid were found to be the best effective 3CLPro inhibitors with inhibitory concentration (IC50) of less than 10 μM. The results from this study showed that Puer and Black tea extracts were more potent than the green or oolong tea extracts in inhibitory activities against 3C-like protease (3CLPro) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), notably the active constituents viz. Theaflavin-3-gallate (TF2b) theaflavin-3,3’-digallate (TF3) and tannic acid were effective 3CLPro inhibitors.

Summarize the research that has been done on the health benefits of black tea regarding the Corona virus.","Research on the health benefits of black tea regarding coronaviruses includes several studies. Theaflavins extracted from black tea were shown to neutralize bovine coronavirus infections, and crude black tea extract also neutralized the coronavirus (Clark et al., 1998). Theaflavin and theaflavin gallate derivatives demonstrated in vitro inactivation activity against coronavirus (Clark et al., 1998).

Regarding SARS-CoV-2 (the COVID-19 virus), a virtual screening study identified theaflavin as the best compound, among 83 screened, for its potential efficacy against the virus by assessing its binding efficiency onto the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (Lung et al., 2020). This finding suggested that theaflavins, which are present in black tea, could serve as lead compounds for developing a SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor targeting RdRp (Lung et al., 2020).

For SARS-CoV (the 2002 epidemic), Theaflavin-3,3’-digallate (TF3) demonstrated inhibition of SARS-CoV 3C-like protease activity (Chen et al., 2005). Extracts from Puer and black tea were found to be more potent in their inhibitory activities against the 3C-like protease (3CLPro) compared to green or oolong tea extracts (Chen et al., 2005). Specifically, the water extracts of theaflavin-3-gallate (TF2b), theaflavin-3,3’-digallate (TF3), and tannic acid were identified as effective 3CLPro inhibitors (Chen et al., 2005).","It's really interesting to see the research emerging on the potential health benefits of black tea, especially concerning coronaviruses! Here's a summary of what the document highlights:

Historically, studies have shown that **theaflavins**, which are key compounds found in black tea, possess antiviral activity against various coronaviruses.

1.  **Early Coronavirus Research (Bovine Coronavirus):** Back in 1998, a study by Clark et al. demonstrated that theaflavins extracted from black tea were able to **neutralize bovine coronavirus infections** in laboratory settings. They also found that crude black tea extract had this neutralizing effect, and interestingly, a combination of different theaflavin fractions showed synergistic activity, meaning they were more effective together than individually.

2.  **SARS-CoV (2002 Epidemic):**
    *   Following the SARS-CoV epidemic, a 2005 study by Chen et al. convincingly showed that specific theaflavin derivatives, like **Theaflavin-3,3’-digallate (TF3)** and **Theaflavin 3-gallate (TF2b)**, along with tannic acid (also present in teas), could **inhibit the SARS-CoV 3C-like protease (3CLPro)** activity. This protease is a critical enzyme that the virus needs to replicate.
    *   The research indicated that extracts from Puer and black tea were more potent inhibitors of this protease compared to green or oolong tea extracts.

3.  **SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19 Pandemic):**
    *   More recently, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, a virtual screening study published in 2020 by Lung et al. investigated various compounds for their potential against **SARS-CoV-2**.
    *   This bioinformatics study specifically looked at how well compounds could bind to the **RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)** of SARS-CoV-2, another essential enzyme for viral replication.
    *   **Theaflavin was identified as the best compound** among 83 tested, showing strong binding affinity to a critical active site on the RdRp. This suggests that theaflavins could be a ""lead compound"" for developing new inhibitors that target SARS-CoV-2.
    *   The document notes that black teas from Assam are particularly rich in theaflavins.

**In essence, the research suggests that compounds found abundantly in black tea, particularly theaflavins, may have the ability to interfere with coronaviruses by:**

*   Directly **inactivating** virus particles.
*   **Blocking essential viral enzymes** like the 3C-like protease (crucial for SARS-CoV) and the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (crucial for SARS-CoV-2), which are vital for the virus to replicate and spread.

It's important to remember that most of these studies are **in vitro** (conducted in test tubes or cell cultures) or **in silico** (computer modeling). While these findings are very promising and point to black tea as a potential source of antiviral agents, the document emphasizes that **further in vivo, animal, and clinical trials would be required** to confirm these benefits and determine efficacy and safety in humans."

PCA of the developmental lipidome of A. suum showed that the difference in the quantity of lipids among five developmental stages/sexes (i.e. L3-egg, L3-lung, L4, Af and Am) was greater than variation within a particular stage (i.e. among four replicates) (Fig 3). The two-dimensional diagram (Fig 3) reveals a clear division of the lipidomic data set into three distinct groups, corresponding to L3-egg, L3-lung and the intestinal stages (i.e. L4, Af and Am). Interestingly, limited variation in lipid amount was observed among adult stages. Of all five developmental stages/sexes, the largest amount of total lipids was measured in third-stage larvae (i.e. L3-egg and L3-lung) (Fig 4A). The semi-quantitative analysis revealed that third-stage larvae (i.e. L3-egg and L3-lung) contained > 150 and 100 μM/mg (micromole of lipids per milligram of dry worm body weight), respectively, whereas ≤ 35 μM/mg were measured in other developmental stages/sexes (i.e. L4, Af and Am) (Fig 4A).
 As expected, lipid categories GP (n = 155 to 253) and GL (n = 44 to 109), for which a large number of lipids species were identified (Table 1), contributed predominantly to the lipid abundance in A. suum across five key developmental stages/sexes (Fig 5 and S1 Fig). The overall GP abundance reached a peak in third-stage larvae (i.e. L3-egg and L3-lung), was significantly lower in later developmental stages/sexes (i.e. L4, Af and Am). Membrane structure-related lipid classes, such as PC, PE and PI, contributed significantly to a low overall GP abundance (Fig 6 and S2 Fig). Individual PC, PE and PI lipid species, such as PC (36:3), PE (O-36:1) and PI (38:4), which contained even-numbered fatty acyl chains (e.g., 18:0, 18:1 or 18:2) predominated in the third-stage larvae (S3 Table). Additionally, LPC, LPE, LPG and LPS classes peaked in L3-lung, and then were substantially reduced during the migration from lung (i.e. L3-lung) to the small intestine (i.e. L4, Af and Am) (S2 Fig). Within the GL category, a significantly higher abundance of TG was measured in L3-egg compared with all other stages/sexes studied (Fig 6). Notably, TG exhibited a slightly higher level in Af than in Am. Deeper analysis of individual lipid species showed that TG lipids with C18 fatty acyl chains (e.g. 18:0, 18:1, 18:2 and 18:3) predominated and that many of these lipids (n = 9) showed a high abundance (> 1 μM/mg) for the TG class (S3 Table). Nevertheless, a significantly higher level of total saturated lipid was observed in L3-lung, whereas high levels of ether-linked lipid were detected in the L3-egg and L3-lung (Fig 7). All lipid classes and individual lipid species as well as their differences in abundance among developmental stages/sexes are given in S2–S4 Figs and S3 Table.
 The two-dimensional PCA showed that lipidomic data of organ systems for male adult Ascaris (i.e. MRT, MAT and MBW) and the body wall from the female worm (i.e. FBW) clustered tightly together, to the exclusion of the reproductive and alimentary tracts of female Ascaris (i.e. FRT and FAT) (Fig 8). Semi-quantitative analysis of the organ systems showed an enrichment of total lipids in the reproductive and alimentary tracts of adult Ascaris (Fig 4B). FRT (141 μM/mg) had > 4 times more lipid overall as compared with MBW (32 μM/mg). Except for the reproductive tract, a comparisons of the same organ system between the sexes showed that the female worm had more total lipids than the male. Similar to the developmental lipidome, GP (ranged 27–134 μM/mg) and GL (ranged 3–49 μM/mg) were the two most abundant lipid categories in A. suum at an organ system level, whereas only small amounts (range: 1–11 μM/mg) of lipids of the SP category were detected (Fig 5 and S1 Fig).
 Regarding the reproductive tract, the overall GP abundance was significantly higher in male (134 μM/mg) than in female (69 μM/mg) (Fig 5B). In contrast, GL abundance showed the opposite trend, with significantly higher levels in FRT (49 μM/mg) than in MRT (3 μM/mg) (Fig 5D). A deeper analysis of the lipidomic data set according to organ system revealed differences primarily in the lipids in the PC, PE and TG classes, characterised by a higher abundance of individual PC species (e.g. PC (16:0_20:4), PC (18:0e_20:2), PC (18:1_20:2) and PC (20:1_18:2)) and PE species (e.g. PE (O-18:0_18:1), PE (O-18:0_20:1)) in FRT compared with MRT; and a higher abundance of TG species, such as TG (17:0_18:2_6:0), TG (18:0_18:1_18:2) and TG (18:1_18:1_6:0), in MRT (S3 Table).
 In the alimentary tract, the total GL amount was more abundant in female (36 μM/mg) than in male (3 μM/mg), whereas the overall GP in the alimentary tract was at a comparable level (nearly 60 μM/mg) in female and male. Notably, individual TG species with even-numbered fatty acyl chains, such as TG (16:0_16:1_18:1), TG (16:1_18:1_18:2) and TG (18:0_18:1_18:2), differed markedly in abundance between FAT and MAT. There was no significant difference in the abundance of overall GP and GL in the body wall. Subsequent analyses revealed that both saturated and either-linked lipids were highly abundant in the reproductive and alimentary tracts of both female and male worms, with no significant difference between the sexes. All lipid classes and individual lipid species as well as their abundance levels in the organ systems are displayed in S2–S4 Figs and S3 Table.

Summarize this biomedical journal article for a layperson. In the summary be sure to include information about the following things: 1. what type of experimental and statistical methods were used to generate and analyze the data? 2. when did PE lipids (a type of GP lipid) reach their peak levels during worm development, 3. how were the alimentary and reproductive tracts differentiated from the other types of tissues examined, and 4. how did GL abundance compare between the male and female reproductive tracts of the worms used in the study?","This study investigated the types and amounts of lipids in the parasitic worm *Ascaris suum* at different life stages and in various body parts.

1.  **Experimental and statistical methods**: The researchers used a technique called **lipidomics** to measure the amount and types of lipids present in the worms (Fig 3). They performed a **semi-quantitative analysis** to determine the lipid levels (Fig 4A). For analyzing the collected data, they employed a statistical method called **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to see how lipid quantities varied among different developmental stages and organ systems (Fig 3, Fig 8). They also conducted ""deeper analysis of individual lipid species"" and ""subsequent analyses"" to understand specific lipid differences (S3 Table).

2.  **Peak PE lipid levels during worm development**: Individual PE (phosphatidylethanolamine) lipid species, which are a type of GP (glycerophospholipid) lipid, were found to predominate in the **third-stage larvae (L3-egg and L3-lung)** (S3 Table).

3.  **Differentiation of alimentary and reproductive tracts from other tissues**: The alimentary and reproductive tracts of female *Ascaris* (FAT and FRT) were distinguished from other tissues because their lipidomic data, when analyzed using two-dimensional PCA, did not cluster with the male reproductive tract (MRT), male alimentary tract (MAT), male body wall (MBW), and female body wall (FBW) (Fig 8). Instead, they were ""to the exclusion of"" this main cluster (Fig 8).

4.  **GL abundance comparison between male and female reproductive tracts**: The abundance of GL (glycerolipid) was significantly higher in the **female reproductive tract (FRT)**, measuring 49 micromoles of lipids per milligram (μM/mg), compared to the **male reproductive tract (MRT)**, which had 3 μM/mg (Fig 5D).","This research dives deep into the world of *Ascaris suum*, a parasitic roundworm, by studying its ""lipidome"" – which is essentially a complete profile of all the fats and fat-like molecules (lipids) found within the worm. The scientists wanted to understand how these lipids change at different stages of the worm's development and how they vary in different organs of adult worms. This kind of information can be really important for understanding the worm's biology and potentially finding new ways to control these parasites.

Here's a breakdown of what they found:

1.  **How they gathered and analyzed the data:**
    To make sense of the vast amount of lipid data, the researchers used a sophisticated statistical technique called **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**. You can think of PCA as a tool that helps simplify complex data, allowing them to visualize clear patterns and group together similar stages or tissues. For example, it showed distinct groups for different developmental stages. They also performed **semi-quantitative analysis** to measure the amounts of specific lipids. This means they weren't just identifying *which* lipids were present, but also getting a good estimate of *how much* of each was there, which is crucial for understanding their biological significance. They also did ""deeper analyses"" to investigate individual lipid types in more detail.

2.  **When PE lipids peaked during development:**
    The study revealed that **PE lipids**, which are a type of glycerophospholipid (GP) crucial for building cell membranes, were most abundant during the worm's **third-stage larval development** (specifically the L3-egg and L3-lung stages). This suggests these lipids play a vital role during these active stages of growth and migration within the host.

3.  **How the alimentary and reproductive tracts stood out:**
    When looking at the adult worms, the **alimentary (digestive) and reproductive tracts**, especially in female worms, showed very distinct lipid profiles compared to other tissues like the body wall. The PCA method demonstrated that the lipid data from these tracts clustered separately, indicating unique lipid compositions. Furthermore, these tracts were ""enriched"" with lipids, meaning they contained a significantly higher total amount of lipids. For instance, the female reproductive tract had over four times more total lipids than the male body wall! This highlights their high metabolic activity and importance for reproduction and digestion.

4.  **GL abundance in reproductive tracts:**
    When comparing the reproductive tracts between male and female worms, there was a striking difference in **GL (glycolipid) abundance**. The **female reproductive tract had a significantly higher amount of GLs** (49 micromoles per milligram of dry worm body weight) compared to the male reproductive tract (a much lower 3 micromoles per milligram). This suggests that glycolipids might have distinct and important functions in the reproductive processes of female *Ascaris suum*.

In essence, this study provides a detailed ""lipid map"" of *Ascaris suum*, showing how lipid compositions change dramatically during different life stages and vary across different organ systems, offering valuable insights into the worm's biology and potential vulnerabilities."

The Antitrust Reform Movement and UMC Rulemaking
The past several years have witnessed renewed interest in antitrust law and policy. Much of this interest
has been driven by concerns that the antitrust laws have been underenforced and that current doctrine is
overly permissive. Since the 1970s, the Supreme Court has reduced the number of per se rules that define
specific conduct as anticompetitive without inquiries into market dynamics and harms in particular cases.
In doing so, the Court has expanded the scope of the “rule of reason”—a standard that, in its current form,
typically involves a burden-shifting framework that requires such inquiries.
Empirical studies have found that the vast majority—as much as 97%—of complaints evaluated under the
rule of reason are dismissed at the first stage of this burden-shifting process, leading some commentators
to argue that the rule of reason is, in practice, a rule of per se legality. Others have criticized the costs and
slow pace of antitrust litigation, which they attribute in part to the detailed analysis required by current
law. Alongside the extension of the rule of reason, the Supreme Court has relaxed several aspects of
monopolization doctrine, limiting the ways in which antitrust law restricts the unilateral conduct of
dominant firms.
Congressional Research Service 3
Advocates of more aggressive antitrust enforcement have supported UMC rulemaking as a means of
counteracting these developments. In 2020, Lina Khan (who now serves as FTC Chair) and Rohit Chopra
(an FTC Commissioner at the time) co-authored an article in which they contended that exclusive reliance
on case-by-case adjudication under the rule of reason had produced “a system of enforcement that
generates ambiguity, unduly drains resources from enforcers, and deprives individuals and firms of any
real opportunity to democratically participate in the process.” They thus argued that the FTC should
supplement antitrust adjudication with UMC rules, which could promote legal clarity, lower enforcement
costs, and allow the public to participate in the formulation of competition policy. Other academic work
from proponents of antitrust reform has likewise urged enforcers and courts to “eschew the open-ended
rule of reason” in favor of simpler presumptions and bright-line rules.
In July 2021, President Biden joined these calls for UMC rulemaking. In an executive order on
competition policy, President Biden encouraged the FTC to exercise its “statutory rulemaking authority
under the Federal Trade Commission Act to curtail the unfair use of non-compete clauses and other
clauses or agreements that may unfairly limit worker mobility.”
Others have identified additional issues that the FTC may seek to address if its UMC rulemaking power is
upheld. A coalition of advocacy groups has filed a petition for rulemaking urging the FTC to prohibit
exclusive dealing by dominant firms. Commentators have also suggested that the FTC may propose rules
targeting reverse-payment settlements in the pharmaceutical industry (often called “pay-for-delay”
agreements), predatory pricing, and manufacturer repair restrictions.
The FTC’s authority to issue such rules—and the Non-Compete Rule—depends not only on whether
Section 6(g) authorizes legislative rulemaking, but also on the scope of Section 5’s prohibition of UMC.
The Supreme Court has repeatedly said that Section 5 is broader than the Sherman Act and the
Clayton Act (the other core federal antitrust laws). However, the scope of this additional coverage—often
called the FTC’s “standalone” Section 5 authority—is unsettled.
Under previous leadership, the FTC took a narrow view of its standalone Section 5 authority. In a 2015
policy statement, the FTC indicated that decisions to bring standalone Section 5 actions would be guided
by considerations of consumer welfare; that the FTC would evaluate challenged conduct under “a
framework similar to the rule of reason”; and that the FTC was less likely to bring a standalone Section 5
action if enforcement of the Sherman Act or Clayton Act was sufficient to address the relevant
competitive harm.
The FTC rescinded this policy statement in 2021 and issued a new Section 5 policy statement the
following year. In the 2022 policy statement, the FTC identified two criteria it will consider in evaluating
whether a “method of competition” is “unfair.” First, the FTC indicated that “unfair” conduct “may be
coercive, exploitative, collusive, abusive, deceptive, predatory, or involve the use of economic power of a
similar nature,” and “may also be otherwise restrictive or exclusionary.” Second, the FTC explained that
such conduct “must tend to negatively affect competitive conditions”—for example, by foreclosing or
impairing the opportunities of market participants, reducing competition between rivals, limiting choice,
or otherwise harming consumers. The 2022 policy statement indicated that this second inquiry will not
turn on whether conduct directly causes harm in particular cases, but instead will focus on whether
conduct “has a tendency to generate negative consequences.”
The FTC framed its 2022 policy statement as a return to the original purposes of the FTC Act. Former
Commissioner Christine Wilson dissented from the statement, arguing that it departed from antitrust’s
traditional focus on consumer welfare and did not provide clear guidance to businesses on how to
structure their conduct to avoid violating the law.

Explain to me how views have changed on anti-trust laws in the US over time.","Since the 1970s, the Supreme Court has reduced the number of per se rules defining conduct as anticompetitive and expanded the scope of the ""rule of reason"" standard, which typically involves a burden-shifting framework requiring inquiries into market dynamics and harms (Congressional Research Service 3). The Court also relaxed aspects of monopolization doctrine, limiting antitrust law's restrictions on the unilateral conduct of dominant firms (Congressional Research Service 3).

More recently, there has been a renewed interest in antitrust law and policy, driven by concerns that the laws have been underenforced and that current doctrine is overly permissive (Congressional Research Service 3). Advocates for more aggressive antitrust enforcement have supported UMC rulemaking to counteract these developments (Congressional Research Service 3).

The Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) views on its Section 5 authority have also changed:
*   **Before 2021 (under previous leadership, notably a 2015 policy statement)**: The FTC took a narrow view of its standalone Section 5 authority, guiding actions by consumer welfare considerations and evaluating conduct under a framework similar to the rule of reason. It was less likely to act if enforcement under the Sherman Act or Clayton Act was sufficient (Congressional Research Service 3).
*   **2021**: The FTC rescinded its 2015 policy statement (Congressional Research Service 3). President Biden encouraged the FTC to exercise its rulemaking authority to curtail unfair non-compete clauses and other agreements limiting worker mobility (Congressional Research Service 3).
*   **2022**: The FTC issued a new Section 5 policy statement, identifying two criteria for ""unfair"" conduct: it ""may be coercive, exploitative, collusive, abusive, deceptive, predatory, or involve the use of economic power of a similar nature"" and ""may also be otherwise restrictive or exclusionary""; and it ""must tend to negatively affect competitive conditions"" (Congressional Research Service 3). This 2022 statement was framed as a return to the original purposes of the FTC Act, although a former Commissioner dissented, arguing it departed from a consumer welfare focus and lacked clear guidance (Congressional Research Service 3).","It's really interesting to see how views on antitrust laws in the US have evolved over time, especially in recent years! The document highlights a significant shift, from a period of more lenient enforcement to a renewed push for more aggressive action.

Here's a breakdown of how those views have changed:

### The Shift Towards Leniency (Post-1970s)

*   **Less Strict Judicial Interpretation:** Starting in the 1970s, the Supreme Court began to scale back the number of ""per se rules."" These rules used to automatically label certain conduct as anticompetitive without needing a deep dive into market specifics.
*   **Expansion of the ""Rule of Reason"":** Instead, the Court expanded the ""rule of reason,"" which requires extensive inquiries into market dynamics and potential harms in each specific case. While designed to be more nuanced, critics argue it became overly permissive.
*   **""Rule of Per Se Legality"" in Practice:** Empirical studies showed that a whopping 97% of complaints evaluated under the rule of reason were dismissed at the first stage. This led some to call it, in practice, a ""rule of per se legality"" – meaning conduct was almost always deemed legal.
*   **Relaxed Monopolization Doctrine:** Alongside this, the Supreme Court also relaxed aspects of monopolization doctrine, giving dominant firms more leeway in their unilateral conduct.
*   **High Costs and Slow Pace:** This approach also contributed to the high costs and slow pace of antitrust litigation due to the detailed analysis required.

### The Rise of the Antitrust Reform Movement (Recent Years)

*   **Concerns Over Underenforcement:** A major driver of the recent ""Antitrust Reform Movement"" is the belief that antitrust laws have been underenforced and that the current doctrine is too permissive, allowing harmful anti-competitive practices to go unchecked.
*   **Advocacy for UMC Rulemaking:** Advocates, including current FTC Chair Lina Khan, have pushed for ""Unfair Methods of Competition (UMC) rulemaking."" They argue that relying solely on case-by-case adjudication under the rule of reason leads to ambiguity, drains resources, and excludes the public from shaping policy.
*   **Goals of Rulemaking:** The aim of UMC rules is to bring more legal clarity, lower enforcement costs, and allow for democratic participation in setting competition policy through ""bright-line rules"" and ""simpler presumptions.""
*   **Presidential Support:** In 2021, President Biden reinforced these calls, encouraging the FTC to use its rulemaking authority to address issues like non-compete clauses and other agreements that limit worker mobility.
*   **Other Potential Targets:** Reformers and advocacy groups have also suggested that the FTC could use UMC rulemaking to tackle exclusive dealing by dominant firms, ""pay-for-delay"" agreements in the pharmaceutical industry, predatory pricing, and manufacturer repair restrictions.

### The FTC's Shifting Stance on ""Standalone"" Section 5 Authority

The Federal Trade Commission's own interpretation of its power to address ""unfair methods of competition"" (Section 5 of the FTC Act) has also seen a significant change:

*   **Previous Narrow View (2015 Policy):** Under prior leadership, the FTC took a more conservative approach. Its 2015 policy statement indicated that decisions to bring standalone Section 5 actions (separate from Sherman or Clayton Acts) would be guided by **consumer welfare**, evaluated under a framework ""similar to the rule of reason,"" and were less likely if existing antitrust laws were sufficient.
*   **Current Broader View (2021/2022 Policy):** This narrow policy was rescinded in 2021, and a new policy statement was issued in 2022. This new view represents a return to what the FTC sees as the *original purposes* of the FTC Act:
    *   **Expanded Definition of ""Unfair"":** ""Unfair"" conduct is now broadly defined as potentially ""coercive, exploitative, collusive, abusive, deceptive, predatory, or involve the use of economic power of a similar nature,"" or ""otherwise restrictive or exclusionary.""
    *   **Focus on Tendency to Harm:** Crucially, the FTC will now look at whether conduct *tends* to negatively affect competitive conditions (e.g., by foreclosing opportunities, reducing rivalry, limiting choice, or harming consumers), rather than requiring proof of direct harm in particular cases.
    *   **Criticism of the Shift:** While supporters see this as a necessary step for stronger enforcement, some, like former Commissioner Christine Wilson, have expressed concerns that it departs from the traditional focus on consumer welfare and may not provide clear guidance for businesses.

In essence, the US has moved from a period where antitrust enforcement became increasingly difficult and narrow, focusing heavily on individual case analysis and consumer welfare, to a current environment where there's a strong push for broader, more proactive enforcement through rulemaking and a reinterpretation of the FTC's powers, aiming to address perceived systemic issues of underenforcement and corporate dominance."

Thank you, Chair Sanders, Ranking Member Cassidy, Senator Murray and the members of the
 Committee for the opportunity to highlight the clear and growing evidence that the Dobbs
 decision is harming reproductive health and freedom. My name is Destiny Lopez, and I am the
 acting co-CEO of the Guttmacher Institute, a leading research and policy organization committed
 to advancing sexual and reproductive health and rights worldwide.
 For decades following the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, anti-abortion advocates worked
 strategically to make abortion harder to get and highly stigmatized. Public support for abortion’s
 legality has remained high and consistent. But the sheer number of state-level abortion
 restrictions ensured that abortion became inaccessible for many—even with Roe in place.
 The Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision was an inflection point,
 unleashing chaos and fear across the nation. Our experts are constantly assessing this changing
 landscape and the increasingly robust body of evidence that illustrates the harms caused and
 exacerbated by Dobbs. Two years after the decision, here is what we know:i
 Access to abortion care is severely restricted in many parts of the country. Fourteen states are
 now enforcing total abortion bans with very limited exceptions, and many more have other new
 restrictions in place. The total number of brick-and-mortar clinics providing abortion care in the
 US declined by more than 40 between 2020 and early 2024.
 Banning abortion does not stop the need for abortion access. Which is why many people seeking
 abortions post-Dobbs must overcome huge financial and logistical barriers to get care, especially
 those in states with total or early gestational bans. The number of Americans traveling out of
 state for abortions doubled from 81,000 in 2020 to more than 170,000 in 2023. States that border
 states with total abortion bans saw the sharpest increases in out-of-state patients.
 No one should have to travel to another state to access basic healthcare. And in fact, those who
 can’t overcome the burdens of travelling for care, which for some might mean crossing multiple
 state lines, may be forced to stay pregnant against their will. Others may decide to self-manage
 their abortion. Decades of research have documented that the majority of people obtaining
 abortions have few financial resources, are people of color, and are already parenting. They are
 the ones most harshly impacted by bans and restrictions.
 We also know that providers are resilient and adapting to meet patient needs. While brick-andmortar facilities provide more than three-quarters of all abortions, online clinics are expanding
 care options by offering medication abortion services via telehealth. Research by the Society for 
 Family Planning shows that virtual-only telehealth abortions accounted for almost one in five
 abortions from October to December 2023.
 There are many other important ways Dobbs is interfering with reproductive health care across
 the nation that I don’t have time to discuss in detail today, from current and future OB-GYNs not
 wanting to practice in ban states to impacts on maternal health and people facing obstetric
 emergencies.
 So what does all this mean? Overturning Roe did not resolve the debates on abortion that have
 characterized US politics for the past 50 years. Instead, it enabled policies that have significantly
 worsened the harms faced by individuals who are most marginalized in our health care system.
 Still, despite these immense hardships and many people being denied care, there were more than
 one million clinician-provided abortions in 2023—a 10% increase from 2020. This is a testament
 to the heroic efforts of providers, abortion funds and other support networks, to the resilience and
 determination of people seeking care, and to the centrality of abortion in peoples’ lives. And it
 explains why the anti-abortion movement and their political allies are doubling down on even
 more repressive policies.
 For instance, this year four states introduced legislation—and one passed a law—criminalizing
 adults who support adolescents seeking abortion care in another state. Earlier in the year, the
 Alabama Supreme Court’s decision to classify frozen embryos as “children” wreaked havoc on
 fertility treatment services while advancing the anti-abortion movement’s long-term goal to
 enshrine fetal personhood in both law and policy. These attacks on bodily autonomy, coupled
 with two major abortion cases currently before the Supreme Court, signal that the policy and
 legal landscape will continue to shift.
 The full damage caused by Dobbs will not be clear for years to come, but the evidence suggests
 it will not be easy to repair. That’s why it is imperative that policymakers at all levels of
 government champion a bold vision of abortion care that goes beyond what Roe promised.
 Only policies rooted in evidence and human rights will guarantee that all people have meaningful
 access to high-quality, affordable abortion care where they live and via the method they choose.
 Thank you.

    *   **Forced Pregnancy and Self-Managed Abortions:** People unable to overcome the financial and logistical burdens of traveling for care may be forced to carry unwanted pregnancies or resort to self-managing their abortions.
    *   **Disproportionate Impact on Marginalized Communities:** Individuals with few financial resources, people of color, and those who are already parenting are most harshly affected by the bans and restrictions.
    *   **Adaptation by Providers:** Providers are becoming resilient, with online clinics expanding care options through telehealth medication abortion services, accounting for almost one in five abortions in late 2023.
    *   **Interference with Broader Reproductive Healthcare:** The decision impacts various aspects of reproductive health, including OB-GYN training and practice locations, maternal health, and handling obstetric emergencies.
    *   **Worsened Harms for Marginalized Individuals:** Overturning Roe enabled policies that have significantly worsened the harms faced by the most marginalized individuals in the healthcare system.
    *   **Continued Political Conflict:** The decision did not resolve the debates on abortion but instead intensified the anti-abortion movement's push for more repressive policies.
    *   **New Legislative and Legal Challenges:** This includes legislation criminalizing support for adolescents seeking out-of-state abortion care, and court decisions like the Alabama Supreme Court classifying frozen embryos as ""children,"" impacting fertility treatments and advancing the concept of ""fetal personhood.""
    *   **Uncertainty and Long-Term Damage:** The full extent of the damage caused by Dobbs is not yet clear, and it is anticipated to be difficult to repair."

 safety stations in each public building that include automated 
 external defibrillators, opioid reversal agents, and 
 hemorrhagic control programs and requests a briefing from each 
 Department within 90 days of enactment of this act on progress 
 towards implementing these guidelines.
  The Committee continues to appreciate the close working 
 relationship with the various budget offices of the agencies 
 funded in this bill. Maintaining these relationships is 
 critical for the Committee to perform its duties in both 
 developing these funding requirements and recommendations and 
 providing oversight over the execution of funds.

OVERVIEW OF HOW NFTS HAVE BEEN CHARACTERIZED
Property law perspective
What rights do owners of NFTs actually own? In this respect, the concept of possession in
property law is currently understood to apply only to tangible assets, and hence inapplicable
to intangible assets.17 Marinoti explores the possibility of understanding the rights owned in
intangibles such as NFTs from a property law perspective.18 He has argued that intangibles such
as NFTs can be governed by property law, through reference to the concepts such as ‘possession’
which is often related mainly to tangible property (i.e., things that are usually physical and that
you can touch and identify, such as land and equipment, etc.).19 According to Marinoti, the
true function of possession is communicative and its purpose is to convey the availability of an
object discernible to an audience. He argued further that communities can also give this meaning through conduct and symbolic acts.20 The narrower concept ‘thinghood’, on the other hand,
is often subsumed within the discussion on possession. Tinghood is defined by whether there
are discernible boundaries around one thing to distinguish it from another. Physical tangibility
is said to be only one way in which thinghood delineates boundaries; social practices and norms
can similarly indicate boundaries.21
Marinoti also suggested that property law doctrines like conversion and trespass can be
extended to apply to digital assets.22 Even concepts such as the relativity of title (ie, wrongful

explicitly written copyright terms. 16 Tese are leading NFT marketplaces. See, eg, Bitdeal, ‘Top 7 NFT Marketplaces to look in 2023 and beyond’ (BLOG,

possession can support an interest held by the wrongful possessor which is stronger than that
of the world at large, save for the right owner) can arguably apply.23 While protecting wrongful
possession may seem unjust, this could help avoid the scenario of having no legal recourse to an
endless series of unlawful conversions of ‘NFTs’ after one single wrongful possession.24 To clarify, Marinoti’s reference to property law concepts drew from both real property and personal
property laws, although this was not expressly stated.
Along the same vein, other scholars such as Trautman and Fairfield have also proposed that
the legal system should treat NFTs as digital personal property because NFTs comprise strong
property interests through enabling parties to buy, sell, or own digital assets similar to personal
property.25
On the other hand, some scholars do not agree that NFTs should be defined as properties.
Lee, for example, has analogized NFTs with library catalog cards to illustrate that the value of
NFTs is derived from their underlying properties (ie, books) and to highlight that people do not
own these properties when they transact in NFTs.26 Further, Moringiello and Odinet rejected
the perception of any property rights in NFTs—through comparison of their characteristics
with those of negotiable instruments, securities, deeds of real property, bills of lading and other
legal tokens—reasoning that NFTs lack the tethering effect that other properties have and that
it is meaningless to view them as such, thus NFT holders do not control anything substantive.27


USER REQUEST:
What is the main argument made by scholars like Moringiello and Odinet against considering NFTs as property?","Moringiello and Odinet rejected the perception of any property rights in NFTs, arguing that NFTs lack the tethering effect that other properties have and that it is meaningless to view them as such, meaning NFT holders do not control anything substantive (27).","Scholars like Moringiello and Odinet argue against considering NFTs as property primarily because they believe **NFTs lack the ""tethering effect"" that other established properties possess.**

They reached this conclusion by comparing the characteristics of NFTs to traditional legal tokens such as:
*   Negotiable instruments
*   Securities
*   Deeds of real property
*   Bills of lading

Their reasoning is that without this ""tethering effect,"" it becomes meaningless to view NFTs as property, as **NFT holders ultimately do not control anything substantive** related to the underlying asset. In essence, they don't see NFTs as providing the same kind of direct control or connection to an asset that traditional property forms offer."
